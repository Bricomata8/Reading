Abstractâ€”Network slicing appears as a key enabler for the future 5G networks. Mobile Network Operators create various slices for Service Providers (SP) to accommodate customized services. As network slices are operated on a common network infrastructure owned by some Infrastructure Provider (InP), sharing the resources across a set of network slices is important for future deployment. Moreover, in many situations, slices have to be deployed over some geographical area: coverage as well as minimum per-user rate constraints have then to be taken into account.
Usually, the various Service Function Chains (SFCs) belonging to a slice are deployed on a best-effort basis. Nothing ensures that the InP will be able to allocate enough resources to cope with the increasing demands of some SP. This paper takes the InP perspective and proposes a slice resource provisioning approach to cope with multiple slice demands in terms of computing, storage, coverage, and rate constraints.
The resource requirements of the various Service Function Chains to be deployed within a slice are aggregated within a graph of Slice Resource Demands (SRD). Coverage and rate constraints are also taken into account in the SRD. Infrastructure nodes and links have then to be provisioned so as to satisfy all types of resource demands. This problem leads to a Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation. A two-step deployment approach is considered, with several variants, depending on whether the constraints of each slide to be deployed are taken into account sequentially or jointly. Once provisioning has been performed, any slice deployment strategy may be considered on the reduced-size infrastructure graph representing the nodes and links on which resources have been provisioned.
Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to a more classical direct slice embedding approach.

I. INTRODUCTION
N ETWORK Function Virtualization (NFV) is attracting widespread interest due to the overall equipment and management cost reductions it allows [1] and to the increased network ï¬‚exibility it provides [2]. Using NFV, network functions are decoupled from their hosting hardware and are offered as virtualized services decomposed in Virtual Network

Functions (VNFs) on general-purpose servers. With cloud networks, infrastructure is also evolving to integrate edge and central data centers onto which VNFs may be deployed by using IT technologies. With the help of virtualization, many dedicated end-to-end network services can co-exist and share the same physical infrastructure, while relying on different network capabilities, protocols and network architecture optimized towards customized requirements. This paves the way to the network slicing concept which has emerged as a new paradigm for 5G networks [3, 4, 5]. Slicing can be applied for deploying business cases such as multi-tenants sharing the same network infrastructure, where tenants, i.e., vertical actors, can operate and manage their own network slice to address applications in energy, e-health, smart city, connected cars [4].
A network slice can be seen as a collection of Service Function Chains (SFCs) and a set of physical network resources, which are dynamically allocated to build a customized logically isolated virtual network. Each SFC consists of several interconnected VNFs describing the processing applied to a data ï¬‚ow related to a given service. With cloudiï¬cation technology, SFCs and VNFs can be easily and ï¬‚exibly initialized, launched, chained, and scaled to meet changeable workload requests [6]. Iterative SFC deployment strategies are wellsuited to such dynamic slice management. Nevertheless, when several concurrent slices are managed in parallel, nothing ensures that enough infrastructure resources will be available to deploy a new SFC. Such best-effort slice management makes it difï¬cult to satisfy a Service Level Agreement (SLA) expressed by tenants in terms, e.g., of guaranteed amount of serviced users. More ï¬‚exible models and mechanisms for network service provisioning and deployment are needed [7]. Additionally, research challenges remain when network slicing incorporates the wireless part of legacy or 5G networks [8, 9], where multiple network segments including the radio access, transport, and core network, have to be considered.
This paper studies the way to efï¬ciently provision and deploy end-to-end network slices on radio and cloud network infrastructure in a multi-tenancy context. Our work focuses on the problem of slice resource provisioning, i.e., reservation. By provisioning we ensure that enough resource is reserved for allocation to further SFC deployment. Enough resource has to be provisioned to deploy SFCs in the network while satisfying coverage constraints for mobile end-users of the slice service. A two-step method is proposed for efï¬cient slice deployment: A resource provisioning process is followed by an SFC embedding process involving any state-of-theart deployment approach, but considering a simpliï¬ed infras-

tructure network reduced to the nodes and links which have provisioned resource. The SFC embedding time may then be much smaller.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section II presents the system architecture, analyzes related work, and highlights our main contributions. The model of the infrastructure network and of the slice resource demands are presented in Section III. The slice resource provisioning problem is then formulated in Section IV as a mixed integer linear programming problem accounting for cloud network and radio resource constraints for the deployment of multiple slices. Numerical results are presented in Section V. Finally, Section VI draws some conclusions and perspectives.

II. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE, RELATED WORK, AND MAIN CONTRIBUTIONS
A. System Architecture
Several entities are involved in network slicing, as described in Figure 1 [1]. The Infrastructure Provider (InP) owns and manages the wireless and wired infrastructure such as the cell sites, the fronthaul and backhaul networks, and cloud data centers. The Mobile Network Operator (MNO) owns the

at the cellular radio sites and the centralized Base Band Unit (BBU) pool hosted in an edge cloud data center [10]. The BBU pool is hosting multiple virtual BBUs, handling higher layer processing functions, whereas all basic radio functions remain at the cellular radio station with the RRH. In 4G, the BBU handles all the L1-L2-L3 functional layers whereas radio frequency functions reside at the RRH. Within 5G, the gNB is split in three parts, namely Central Unit (CU), Distributed Unit (DU), and Radio Unit (RU), and different functional splits are under study where in some options the RU can support some L2 functions thus reducing the capacity required for the fronthaul link [11]. The link (interface) between the BBU and the RRH is known as the fronthaul whereas the backhaul network connects the BBU with the core network functions hosted in the regional or central cloud.

virtual network functions and leases the physical resources provided by the InPs to setup and manage the slices. Finally, the tenant (or Service Provider, SP) exploits the slices supplied by the MNO, and provides to his customers the required services that are running within the slices. Service needs are forwarded by the tenant to the MNO within an SLA. The SLA describes, at a high level of abstraction, characteristics of the service with the desired QoS, the number of devices (or the device/user density), the geographical region where the service has to be made available for the end-users, etc. The MNO translates the tenant high-level demands into SFCs able to fulï¬ll the service requirements. SFCs are then deployed on the network infrastructure so that QoS requirements are satisï¬ed. To perform this deployment, the InP has to identify the infrastructure nodes on which the VNFs are deployed and the links able to transmit data between these nodes. Given a set of SFC demands, this consists in ï¬nding i) the placement of the VNFs on the data center nodes and ii) the routing of data ï¬‚ows between the VNFs, while respecting the structure of SFCs and optimizing a given objective (e.g., minimizing the infrastructure and software fees cost). In particular, it has also to take into account the coverage constrains for the service and to select the base station nodes accordingly.
In this work, we adopt the Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) architecture, a cloud architecture for future mobile network, illustrated in Figure 2. The C-RAN nodes (i.e., eNB for 4G and gNB for 5G) mainly consists of two parts: The distributed Remote Radio Heads (RRHs) plus antennas deployed

B. Related Work
Early results on assigning infrastructure network resources to virtual network components may be found, e.g., in [12, 13]. Due to its capability of sharing efï¬ciently network resource in 5G networks, the concept of network virtualization has gained renewed attention in the literature [5, 14, 15, 16] via the concept of network slicing.
Network slice resource allocation is a complex problem. When a slice instance is seen as a collection of SFCs, slice embedding needs to deploy the SFCs on a shared infrastructure while satisfying various constraints. Most of prior works related to SFC and VNF deployment do not account for coverage constraints. For example, in [17, 18], computing, storage, and aggregated wireless resource demands of SFCs are considered. The minimization of the SFC embedding cost is formulated either as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) [18, 19, 20] or as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem [13, 21], which are known to be NP-hard [22]. In [23], the VNF placement problem is expressed as an Integer Quadratic Programming (IQP) problem with a set of energy consumption constraints, and then is transformed to a solvable linear form.
To address the high computational complexity resulting from the ILPs or MILPs, various heuristics have been proposed, see, e.g., [17, 18, 19]. For example, [17] introduced an heuristic based on the search of shortest paths to sequentially embed the SFCs. In [18], the candidate infrastructure nodes

PREPRINT

are sorted to ï¬nd the best node, in terms of deployment cost, to host a given VNF. Its neighbors are then considered as candidates to deploy the next VNF.
The Column Generation (CG) technique has been widely studied to solve large ILP problems [24]. In the CG approach, the original ILP is decomposed into a Master Problem (MP) and a Pricing Problem (PP). The MP is the original problem where only a subset of variables is considered. The PP is a new problem created to identify a new variable, i.e., a column, to add to the MP to improve the current solution. In [24] or [25], CG has been used to relax ILP-based SFC embedding or reconï¬guration problems. Speciï¬cally, in [24], the SFC embedding problem is addressed. Only core capacity and bandwidth resources for infrastructure nodes and links are considered. In [25], the embedding of new SFCs and the re-adjustment of in-service SFCs are both considered. Re-adjustment of inservice SFCs may imply the migration of VNFs and virtual links may need to be updated to meet changes of resource demands. This problem is again formulated as an ILP where the objective is to minimize the deployment as well as the migration costs. Only linear SFCs are allowed and any node with radio ressource may serve as access point for the users, which makes difï¬cult the satisfaction of coverage constraints. Moreover, possible paths in the network are assumed to be available, which needs some computational effort before the deployment.
In [26], the join VNF and virtual link placement is formulated as a Weighted Graph Matching Problem (WGMP), where the SFC graph and the infrastructure graph are modeled as weighted graphs, on which each node and each link have their own weight corresponding to their required resource (for the SFC graph), or their available resource (for the infrastructure graph). An eigendecomposition-based method is then proposed to solve the WGMP problem, which aim is to ï¬nd, with a signiï¬cantly reduced complexity, the optimum matching between the SFC graph and the infrastructure graph. In [24], [25], and [26], a unique type of resource is considered at infrastructure nodes (processing) and at links (bandwidth). Radio resource is not considered.
The resource allocation problem among competing slices in an heterogeneous cloud infrastructure is addressed in [27]. Slice resource demands are aggregated in a vector of VNF resource demands in the slice multiplied by a coefï¬cient linked to the number of services to be processed per time unit. The considered types of resource are CPU, memory, bandwidth, and storage. The resource allocation among multiple slices is performed considering two different approaches. The ï¬rst approach involves a centralized convex optimization problem, which objective is to maximize the total slice utility. Nevertheless, as pointed out in [27], such centralized lacks of scalability, is not robust to a failure of the central optimizer, and is prone to non-collaborative slice providers which may harm the system. For these reasons, a distributed method based on game theory is considered to improve robustness and scalability. Optimization is performed in a decentralized way among the data centers and slice providers, and the results provided by all entities will provide the ï¬nal resource allocation for all slices. Nevertheless, the placement of VNFs in data centers

is predetermined by the MNO and again, wireless resources are not considered. A resource aggregation scheme similar to that in [27] has been introduced in our previous work [28], where infrastructure resources are provisioned to satisfy slice resource demand constraints. Radio resources are considered, but radio coverage constraints are still ignored.
The design of efï¬cient allocation mechanisms for virtualized radio resources has been recently addressed in [29]. This paper aims at minimizing the leasing cost of BSs so as to meet SP demands, while providing, with a given probability, a minimum data rate for any user located in their coverage area. The rate constraint is expressed as a linear function of the BS load (number of users served by the BS), of the distance from user to the nearest BS, and of the downlink interference. This linear approximation, however, requires some assumptions. For instance, a user of an SP is assumed to be served by its nearest BS among the set of BSs allocated to the SP. This reduces somehow the potentiality of achieving the optimal sharing of the radio resource.
In [30], an heterogeneous spatial user density is considered, and the joint BS selection and adaptive slicing are formulated as a two-stage stochastic optimization problem. The ï¬rst stage aims at deï¬ning the set of BSs to activate. The second stage aims at allocating wireless resources of the BSs to each point of the region to be covered by the SP. Several random realizations of user locations are generated to get a reduced-complexity deterministic optimization problem. A genetic algorithm is then used for the optimization.
In [31], a network slicing framework for Multi-Tenant Heterogeneous CRAN (H-CRAN) is introduced. The sharing of radio resources in terms of data rate is considered, with some constraints related to the fronthaul capacity, the transmission power budget of RRHs, or the tolerable interference threshold of an RRH on a sub-channel. Slicing is formulated as a weighted throughput maximization problem, which aims at maximizing the total rate obtained by users connected to given RRHs on given sub-channels. Nevertheless, the proposed framework does not consider computing and memory resource associated to the processing within the BBUs. Such resource is assumed to be properly scaled so as to support the required service rate. Moreover, the proposed framework addresses only downlink data services.
The wireless network slicing problem is also addressed in [32]. A game theory-based distributed algorithm to solve the problem is proposed. The proposed algorithm accounts for the limited availability of wireless resources and considers different aspects such as congestion, deployment costs and the RRH-user distance. This work considered the coverage area of RRH, but ignored the possible coverage constraints required by the slices.
C. Main Contributions
Compared to previous works, we consider slice resource demands in terms of coverage and trafï¬c requirements in the radio access part of the network as well as network, storage, and computing requirements from a cloud infrastructure of interconnected data centers for the rest of the network. This

work borrows the slice resource provisioning approach introduced in [28], and adapts it to the joint radio and network infrastructure resource provisioning. Constraints related to the infrastructure network considered in [17, 18, 27, 28] are combined with coverage and radio resource constraints introduced in [29, 30, 31, 32].
In this work, we assume that the resource requirements for the various SFCs that will have to be deployed within a slice may be aggregated and represented by a Slice Resource Demand (SRD) graph that mimics the graph of SFCs. These SRDs are evaluated by the MNO to satisfy the QoS requirements imposed by the tenant. The InP has then to provision enough infrastructure resources to meet the SLA. Due to the fact that nodes or links of the graph of SRDs represent aggregate requirements, several infrastructure nodes may have to be gathered and parallel physical links have to be considered to satisfy the various SRDs. This is the main difference with respect to the traditional service chain embedding approach considered for example in [17, 18], where each VNF is deployed on a single node. In [17, 18], virtual nodes and links are mapped on the infrastructure network to allocate resources to VNFs and virtual links. In this paper, one provisions a sufï¬cient number of infrastructure nodes and links, so that the aggregated provisioned resources meet the slice demands represented by the graph of SRDs.
When provisioning slices, we consider coverage constraints, in which slices are assumed to cover a speciï¬c region in the considered geographical area, that is part of the SLA with the tenant. We devise the special case of the cloud RAN architecture with RRHs which are nodes having radio resources. In our model, radio resource blocks are allocated and the channel between the RRH nodes and users is taken into account. Compared with [29], the selected BS is not necessarily the nearest one. Moreover, both downlink and uplink trafï¬c are considered for the service rate model.
III. SYSTEM MODEL
Consider a set of SPs which aim is to provide different services, indexed by Ïƒ = 1, . . . , |S|, to mobile users. The geographical area under study is denoted A and the subarea over which service Ïƒ has to be made available is denoted AÏƒ. For that purpose, each SP forwards his service requirements to an MNO, which aim is to design a network slice able to satisfy these requirements. The MNO sends to the InP a Slice Resource Demand (SRD). This SRD consists of (i) an SRD graph accounting for the structure and SLA of the slice, and (ii) SRD coverage information related to the area AÏƒ over which the service will have to be made available. The InP is then in charge of provisioning enough infrastructure resources to deploy the SFCs, which resource demands have been described by the SRD graph.
This section details the model of the infrastructure provided by the InP and the way a service with wireless coverage constraints can be mapped to a slice with speciï¬c SRD graph.

where NI is the set of infrastructure nodes and EI is the set of infrastructure links, which correspond to the wired connections between nodes and within nodes (loopback links) of the infrastructure network.
Each infrastructure node i âˆˆ NI is characterized by a given amount of computing and storage resources, denoted as ac(i) and as(i), which may be allocated to network slices. Radio resources are exclusively provided by a subset NIr âŠ‚ NI of RRH nodes, which location in some Cartesian frame attached to A is denoted xri. The cost associated to the use of an infrastructure node i consists of a ï¬xed part cf (i) for node disposal and variable parts cc(i), cs(i), and cr(i), which depend linearly on the amount of computing, storage, and radio resources provided by that node.
Each infrastructure link ij âˆˆ EI connecting node i to j has a bandwidth of ae(ij), and an associated per-unit bandwidth cost ce(ij). Several distinct VNFs of the same slice may be deployed on a given infrastructure node. When communication between these VNFs is required, an internal (loopback) infrastructure link ii âˆˆ EI can be used at each node i âˆˆ NI, as in [33], in the case of interconnected virtual machines (VMs) deployed on the same host. The associated per-unit bandwidth cost, in that case, is ce (ii).
B. SRD Model
An SRD is deï¬ned on the basis of an SLA between a tenant and an MNO. In what follows, we consider SLAs involving coverage constraints, related to the geographical distribution of the end-users of the service provided by the slice. This distribution is described by the user density function ÏÏƒ(x), with x âˆˆ A. The SLA is also expressed in terms of the supported service type and the targeted QoS such as a minimum average data rate RÏƒu and RÏƒd for the wireless uplink and downlink trafï¬c for each client.
As an example, Figure 3 illustrates three geographical subareas over which three different services have to be deployed.

graph that mimics the graph of SFCs. The SRD graph for slice Ïƒ is an oriented graph denoted GVÏƒ = (NVÏƒ, EVÏƒ ), where NVÏƒ and EVÏƒ are respectively the set of (virtual) SRD nodes and links. The SRD graph has a structure close to the SFC
graph, with SRD nodes corresponding to the VNFs of the SFC. Each SRD node v âˆˆ NVÏƒ is characterized by a given amount of required computing and storage resources, denoted rc(v) and rs(v) to sustain the aggregated demand for all instances of a given VNF in the slice. Each link vw âˆˆ EVÏƒ , connecting node v to w in the SRD graph, is characterized by the bandwidth rb(vw) required to sustain the aggregated trafï¬c demand between the VNFs associated to v and w.
SFCs will be deployed on the infrastructure nodes and
links which have provisioned resources. Enough resources
should be provisioned by each node to be able to host a
minimum number of VNFs. Consequently, when resources are provisioned on a node, a minimum amount rc(v) and rs(v) of such resources should be provisioned.
One also assumes that the uplink and downlink radio resource demands are represented by a single node vr of the SRD graph. The aggregated uplink and downlink data rates ru (vr) and rd (vr) are associated to the coverage constraint of slice Ïƒ

Figure 4 illustrates the SFCs required for the deployment of a web browsing service with advertisement removal inspired by [34] and its associated SRD graph. Figure 4a describes the eight VNFs to be deployed, including: three RAN VNFs namely a Radio Unit (RU) to handle RF operations, a Data Unit (DU) and a Centralized Unit for User-Plane Functions (CU-UP) to handle computing and processing loads; and ï¬ve VNFs placed in the core network, namely a User-Plane Function (UPF), a private storage management function, a ï¬rewall, an advertisement blocker, and a Network Address Translation (NAT). Each of these VNFs is characterized by computing and storage requirements. Some links are bidirectional, e.g., between the UPF and the ï¬rewall, others are unidirectional, e.g., the uplink trafï¬c from users has not to go through the advertisement blocker. The corresponding SRD graph is represented in Figure 4b. All identical instances of SFCs deployed within the slice are represented by a single graph which structure is identical to the SFC graph. The requirements in terms of storage, computing, and wireless capacity of each component of the SRD graph aggregate the corresponding requirements of the components of the SFC graph. See Section V for more details.
A second example is provided in Figure 5, which represents the SFCs required for the deployment of an adaptive wireless video streaming service and its associated SRD graph taken from [35]. Figure 5a represents the VNFs for the user-plane of the 5G-RAN (RU, DU, CU-UP), the 5G-Core (UPF), and the server and Video Optimization Controller (VOC) placed in the data network.

IV. PROBLEM FORMULATION
Our aim is to provision resources from the infrastructure for the slices managed by an MNO. This provisioning is represented by a mapping between the infrastructure graph GI and the SRD graph GVÏƒ, as illustrated in Figure 6. In this example, the slice Ïƒ is described by an SRD graph aggregating the demands of several linear SFCs. The constraints which have to be satisï¬ed by this mapping are detailed in the following sections.

A. Accounting for SRD Coverage Constraints
For the slice Ïƒ, the InP has to provide a minimum average data rate (RÏƒu for uplink and RÏƒd for downlink) to each

mobile user spread over AÏƒ with a density ÏÏƒ (x). For that purpose, the InP will have to provision resources from the RRH nodes in NIr. One assumes that every RRH node is able to provide a ï¬xed amount ar (i) of resource blocks (RB) per time unit to exchange data (up and downlink) with users. The amount of data transmitted using a single RB depends on the characteristics of the RRH, of the User Equipment (UE), and on the transmission channel between the RRH and the user.
During the resource provisioning phase, the locations of users are unknown. To address this problem, [30] considers different realizations of a point process representing the location of users. Here an approach inspired by the subarea partitioning technique introduced in [36] is considered. AÏƒ is partitioned into QÏƒ convex subareas AÏƒq , q âˆˆ QÏƒ = {1, . . . , QÏƒ}. Instead of allocating RBs to users, RRH nodes allocate RBs to subareas. The way the partitioning is performed is not detailed here. One may consider, e.g., a partitioning into squares of

Î·uÏƒ (i, q) ar (i) bu xri, AÏƒq â‰¥ ru (vr) ,
qâˆˆQÏƒ iâˆˆNIr
Î·dÏƒ (i, q) ar (i) bd xri, AÏƒq â‰¥ rd (vr) , (4)
qâˆˆQÏƒ iâˆˆNIr

which ensures, for slice Ïƒ, the satisfaction of the part of the SRD graph related to the uplink and downlink radio resource demands.
For each RRH i, the amount of provisioned uplink and downlink resources should be proportional to the demand expressed in the SRD graph through ru (vr) and rd (vr). This avoids provisioning RRH resources taking care only of the uplink or only of the downlink trafï¬c. This has to be ensured for all subareas q âˆˆ QÏƒ

Î·uÏƒ (i, q) ar (i) bu xri, AÏƒq = Î·dÏƒ (i, q) ar (i) bd xri, AÏƒq . (5)

ru (vr)

rd (vr)

To identify whether a RRH i âˆˆ NIr has provisioned some
RBs to any subarea for slice Ïƒ, one introduces the variables Î·Ïƒ (i) âˆˆ {0, 1}, with Î·Ïƒ (i) = 1 if qâˆˆQÏƒ Î·Ïƒ (i, q) > 0, and Î·Ïƒ (i) = 0 otherwise. The variables Î·Ïƒ (i, q) and Î·Ïƒ (i) are gathered in the sets Î· = {Î·Ïƒ (i, q)}iâˆˆNIr,qâˆˆQÏƒ,ÏƒâˆˆS and Î· = {Î·Ïƒ (i)}iâˆˆNIr,ÏƒâˆˆS . The relation between Î·Ïƒ (i, v, q) and

PREPRINT

7

Î·Ïƒ (i) is nonlinear. Nevertheless, both quantities can be linked with the following linear constraints

0 â‰¤ Î·Ïƒ (i) âˆ’

Î·Ïƒ (i, q) < 1, âˆ€i âˆˆ NIr, âˆ€Ïƒ âˆˆ S, (6)

qâˆˆQÏƒ

where

Î·Ïƒ (i, q) = Î·uÏƒ (i, q) + Î·dÏƒ (i, q) .

(7)

The cost related to the radio resource provisioning for a given slice Ïƒ gathers the ï¬xed costs cf (i) Î·Ïƒ (i) related to the use of a RRH by the slice and the variable costs crar (i) Î·Ïƒ (i, q) related to the amount of RBs provided by each RRH to the slice. Some bias towards allocation of RBs
by RRHs to subareas which will provide a high data rate
is obtained by the introduction of a rate-related discount Î»b xri, AÏƒq ar (i) Î·Ïƒ (i, q). The resulting cost function for the radio resources is

B. Accounting for Other SRD Constraints

This section introduces a set of constraints which have to

be satisï¬ed to address the other resource demands for each

ÏƒâˆˆS, while being consistent with the coverage constraints.

For that purpose, one introduces ï¬rst Î¦n =

{Ï†Ïƒn the

(i, v)}iâˆˆNI,vâˆˆNVÏƒ,ÏƒâˆˆS,nâˆˆ{c,s} proportion of resources of

, where type n

Ï†Ïƒn(i, v) âˆˆ {c, s}

represents provisioned

on the infrastructure node i âˆˆ GI for the SRD node v âˆˆ NVÏƒ

of slice Ïƒ. Second, let Î¦b where Ï†Ïƒb (ij, vw) represents

= {Ï†Ïƒb (ij, vw)}ijâˆˆEI,vwâˆˆEVÏƒ,ÏƒâˆˆS , the proportion of bandwidth of

the infrastructure link ij âˆˆ EI provisioned for the SRD link

vw âˆˆ EVÏƒ of slice Ïƒ. Both Î¦n and Î¦b are sets of non-negative

real variables ranging from 0 to 1. When one of the variables

holds zero, there is no mapping between the infrastructure

and the SRD node/link.

The sum of resources provided by each infrastructure node

i âˆˆ NI mapped to an SRD node v should satisfy its resource

demands. This leads to

an (i) Ï†Ïƒn(i, v) â‰¥ rn(v), âˆ€n âˆˆ {c, s}, âˆ€v âˆˆ NVÏƒ, âˆ€Ïƒ âˆˆ S.
iâˆˆNI
(9)
Since, the summed proportions of resources provisioned by a given infrastructure node i cannot exceed one, we have

Ï†Ïƒn(i, v) â‰¤ 1, âˆ€n âˆˆ {c, s}, âˆ€i âˆˆ Ns.

(10)

ÏƒâˆˆS vâˆˆNVÏƒ

Similarly, the cumulative proportions of resources provisioned by a given infrastructure link ij cannot exceed one

Ï†Ïƒb (ij, vw) â‰¤ 1, âˆ€ij âˆˆ EI.

(11)

ÏƒâˆˆS vwâˆˆEVÏƒ

The amount of resources provided by a given infrastructure node i to an SRD node v has to be equal to an integer multiple

of the minimum amount of resources rn for VNFs associated to the SRD node v

an(i)Ï†Ïƒn(i, v) = rn(v)ÎºÏƒn(i, v), âˆ€i âˆˆ NI, âˆ€v âˆˆ NVÏƒ, âˆ€n âˆˆ {c, s}, âˆ€Ïƒ âˆˆ S,

(12)

where ÎºÏƒn(i, v) is a positive integer. This ensures that enough resources are provisioned by an infrastructure node i to be able to deploy ÎºÏƒn(i, v) VNFs associated to the SRD node v.
Moreover, resources of each type have to be provisioned in a
balanced way by an infrastructure node for an SRD node, con-
sistent with its demands. For example, if an infrastructure node provides 10% of the computing demand of a given SRD node, it should also provide 10% of the storage demand of this SRD
node. This translates into the following resource provisioning proportionality constraints âˆ€i âˆˆ NI and âˆ€v âˆˆ NVÏƒ, âˆ€Ïƒ âˆˆ S,

racc((vi))Ï†Ïƒc (i, v) = rass((vi))Ï†Ïƒs (i, v).

(13)

Additionally, considering the SRD node vr, the computing
and storage resources provisioned by an infrastructure node i âˆˆ NIr should be commensurate with the provisioned wireless resources, âˆ€Ïƒ âˆˆ S,

racc((vir))Ï†Ïƒc (i, vr) = rass((vir))Ï†Ïƒs (i, vr)

= ar (i) rr(vr) qâˆˆQÏƒ

Î·uÏƒ (i, q) bu

xri, AÏƒq

+ Î·dÏƒ (i, q) bd

xri, AÏƒq . (14)

The constraints (13) and (14) ensure a balanced resource provisioning by infrastructure nodes. In (14), rr(vr) is the total radio resource demand of vr in both up and downlink, i.e., rr(vr) = ru(vr) + rd(vr).
Moreover, link resources should be consistently provisioned with the radio resource of the RRH for both uplink and downlink. Thus, for downlink trafï¬c (links with RRH as egress), one should have

iâˆˆNI\NIr rabb((vivjr))Ï†Ïƒb (ij, vvr) =

rb(vvr)

ar (j)

qâˆˆQÏƒ

(15)

âˆ€j âˆˆ NIr, âˆ€vvr âˆˆ EVÏƒ , and âˆ€Ïƒ âˆˆ S. In (15), the term ar (j) qâˆˆQÏƒ Î·dÏƒ (j, q) bd xrj, AÏƒq /rd(vr) represents the proportion of downlink radio resources provided by RRH j
to satisfy the downlink demand of vr. When several SRD links feed vr, the term rb(vvr)/ uvrâˆˆEVÏƒ rb(uvr) represents the proportion of (downlink) trafï¬c demand associated to the
SRD link vvr. The right-hand side of (15) represents thus the proportion of the data trafï¬c that has to be provisioned for the
SRD link vvr to satisfy the part of the downlink radio resource provided by RRH j to satisfy the part of the downlink demand
of vr. The left-hand side of (15), represents the proportion of the data trafï¬c that is provided by all infrastructure links ij, i âˆˆ NI\NIr for the SRD link vvr. Both terms have thus to be equal.

PREPRINT

For uplink trafï¬c (links with RRH as ingress), one has

jâˆˆNI\NIr rabb((virjv))Ï†Ïƒb (ij, vrv) =

rb(vrv)

ar (i)

vruâˆˆEVÏƒ rb(vru) ru(vr)

Î·uÏƒ (i, q) bu xri, AÏƒq ,

qâˆˆQÏƒ

(16)

âˆ€i âˆˆ NIr, âˆ€vrv âˆˆ EVÏƒ , and âˆ€Ïƒ âˆˆ S. In (16), the term ar (i) qâˆˆQÏƒ Î·uÏƒ (i, q) bu xri, AÏƒq /ru(vr) represents now the proportion of uplink radio resources provided by RRH i to satisfy the uplink demand of vr. When several SRD links depart from vr, the term rb(vrv)/ vruâˆˆEVÏƒ rb(vru) represents the proportion of (uplink) trafï¬c demand associated to the SRD link vrv. The right-hand side of (16) represents thus the proportion of the data trafï¬c that has to be provisioned for the SRD link vrv to convey the part of the uplink radio resource provided by RRH i to satisfy the part of the uplink demand of vr. The left-hand side of (16), represents the proportion of the data trafï¬c that is provided by all infrastructure links ij, j âˆˆ NI\NIr for the SRD link vrv. Both terms have again to be equal.
Finally, ï¬‚ow conservation constraints have to be satisï¬ed when resources are provisioned on the infrastructure link ij for the SRD link vw. That is, for each SRD link vw âˆˆ Ev , a path of infrastructure links must be provisioned between each pair of infrastructure nodes that are mapped to the pair (v, w) of SRD nodes.
Consider ï¬rst an infrastructure node i which provisions resources for two SRD nodes v and w. The corresponding VNFs will have to exchange information within the considered node i via the internal link ii. For such internal link providing resources to an SRD link, one should have âˆ€Ïƒ âˆˆ S

rabb((viwi))Ï†Ïƒb (ii, vw) = =

rb(vw) vuâˆˆEVÏƒ rb(vu)
rb(vw) uwâˆˆEVÏƒ rb(uw)

racc((vi))Ï†Ïƒc (i, v) (17)
racc((wi))Ï†Ïƒc (i, w). (18)

In (17), the term ac(i)Ï†Ïƒc (i, v)/rc(v) represents the proportion of computing resources provided by the infrastructure node i to meet the demand of the SRD node v. When several SRD links depart from v, the term rb(vw)/ vuâˆˆEVÏƒ rb(vu) represents the proportion of trafï¬c demand that departs from v associated to the SRD link vw. The right-hand side of (17) represents thus the proportion of the data trafï¬c that has to be provisioned for the SRD link vw to satisfy the corresponding proportion of computing resources provided by i to satisfy the part of the demand of v. The left-hand side of (16) represents the proportion of the data trafï¬c that is provided by the internal link ii for the SRD link vw. The constraint (18) can be justiï¬ed similarly.
Consider now an SRD link vw and an infrastructure node i which provisions resources either for only one of the SRD nodes v or w, or for none of them. Focusing again on the computing resource, three cases have to be considered.

Assume ï¬rst that i provisions resources for v. Then one has the following constraint âˆ€Ïƒ âˆˆ S

jâˆˆNI rabb((viwj))Ï†Ïƒb (ij, vw) =

rb(vw) vuâˆˆEVÏƒ rb(vu)

racc((vi))Ï†Ïƒc (i, v). (19)

The right-hand side of (19) is the same as that of (17). The

left-hand side of (19) represents the proportion of the trafï¬c

provisioned by all links ij, j âˆˆ NI (leaving node i) for the SRD link vw.

Assume second that i provisions resources for w. Then one

has the following constraint âˆ€Ïƒ âˆˆ S

jâˆˆNI rabb((viwj))Ï†Ïƒb (ji, vw) =

rb(vw) uwâˆˆEVÏƒ rb(uw)

racc((wi))Ï†Ïƒc (i, w). (20)

The right-hand side of (20) is the same as that of (18). The

left-hand side of (20) represents now the proportion of the

trafï¬c provisioned by all links ji, j âˆˆ NI (feeding node i) for the SRD link vw.

Assume ï¬nally that i provisions resources neither for v nor

for w. Then the following ï¬‚ow-conservation constraint

jâˆˆNI rabb((viwj))Ï†Ïƒb (ij, vw) âˆ’ rabb((vjwi))Ï†Ïƒb (ji, vw) = 0 (21)
must be satisï¬ed âˆ€Ïƒ âˆˆ S. The constraints (19-21) can be gathered in the following
single constraint

jâˆˆNI rabb((viwj))Ï†Ïƒb (ij, vw) âˆ’ rabb((vjwi))Ï†Ïƒb (ji, vw)

=

rb(vw) vuâˆˆEVÏƒ rb(vu)

âˆ€i âˆˆ NI, âˆ€vw âˆˆ EVÏƒ , âˆ€Ïƒ âˆˆ S.

In (17), (18), and (22), the consistency with the other

provisioned resources is ensured by (13).

Figures 7 illustrate two resource provisioning examples for

simpliï¬ed SRD graphs with branched topologies. In Figure 7a,

the node i1 is mapped onto v1, i2 is mapped onto the pair

(v2, v3); and the link i1i2 is mapped onto the pair (v1v2, v1v3).

Considering the infrastructure node i1 and the SRD link

and

and Ï†b(i1i2, v2v3)

The

Thus, a two-step provisioning algorithm denoted CARP (Coverage-Aware Resource Provisioning), Algorithm 1, is introduced to minimize both terms of (25) separately. The Radio resource Provisioning problem, denoted RP, with the radio coverage constrains introduced in Section IV-A, is solved ï¬rst. Then, using the solution of the RP problem, the Network resource Provisioning, denoted NP, considering the other resources constraints introduced in Section IV-B, is solved by CARP.

To indicate whether infrastructure nodes have provisioned

resources for some SRD node, one introduces the set of binary

variables Î¦ = Ï†Ïƒ(i, v)

, which represents

iâˆˆNI,vâˆˆNVÏƒ ,ÏƒâˆˆS

node mapping indicators, i.e., Ï†Ïƒ(i, v) = 1 if at least one

of the elements of {Ï†Ïƒc (i, v), Ï†Ïƒs (i, v)} is strictly positive, and Ï†Ïƒ(i, v) = 0 otherwise. The relation between Ï†Ïƒn(i, v) and
Ï†Ïƒn(i, v) is again nonlinear. As in (6), both quantities may be

linearly related as follows

Ï†Ïƒn(i, v) â‰¤ Ï†(i, v) <

(24)

where the ï¬rst and second terms indicate the total cost for leasing resources from infrastructure nodes and links, while the third term represents the cost for deploying VNFs in infrastructure nodes.

C. Single-step vs Two-step Provisioning
The global provisioning problem has to account for storage and computing constraints, as well as coverage constraints. It leads to the minimization of the sum of the costs (24) and (8)

ctot = crr (Î·, Î·) + cw Î¦n, Î¦, Î¦b

(25)

with the constraints introduced in Sections IV-A and IV-B. Nevertheless, when the number of variables in (Î¦n, Î¦, Î¦b)
and (Î·, Î·) increases, the problem may become intractable.

During initialization of CARP, the slice coverage information (AÏƒ) is obtained from the SRD, and AÏƒ is partitioned into QÏƒ convex subareas AÏƒq , q âˆˆ QÏƒ = {1, . . . , QÏƒ};
In Step 1, the values of Î· and Î· minimizing crr (Î·, Î·) while satisfying all constraints related to radio provisioning ((2)-(7)) are evaluated;
In Step 2, the values of Î¦n, Î¦, Î¦b minimizing
cw Î¦n, Î¦, Î¦e , subject to the constraints (9)-(23) are
evaluated. The constraints (14), (15), (16) are evaluated with the help of Î· and Î· obtained at Step 1.
When the resource provisioning problem has to be solved for several slices, each of the RP and NP problems can be addressed either sequentially for each slice, or jointly for all slices. Denote SR and JR for sequential and joint RP, and similarly SN and JN for sequential and joint NP. Combining these methods gives four variants of the provisioning algorithm (SR_SN, SR_JN, JR_SN, and JR_JN), as summarized in Table II with the number of RP and NP problems and the corresponding number of variables per problem to be handled by each variant. In Table II, the variables ÎºÏƒn(i, v) introduced in (12) are not taken into account, since they are directly related to Ï†Ïƒn(i, v).
The sequential variants (SR and SN) require to solve |S| more optimization problems, but with |S| less variables. Since

PREPRINT

10

each problem is NP-hard, the sequential variants may obviously be solved faster than the joint variants (JR and JN). Section V-B compares these variants on simulations.

V. EVALUATION
In this section, one evaluates via simulations the performance of the proposed provisioning algorithms. First, a simpliï¬ed scenario addressing only the NP problem is considered in Section V-A to illustrate the beneï¬ts of provisioning prior to SFC embedding. Then, the variants of the provisioning algorithm introduced in Section IV-C considering also coverage constraints are compared in Section V-B. All simulations are performed with the CPLEX MILP solver interfaced with MATLAB.
A. Resource Provisioning vs Direct Embedding
In this section, no coverage constraints are considered. Radio resources are provisioned in the same way as computing and storage resources, i.e., independently of any coverage constraint. Infrastructure resources are ï¬rst provisioned for different slices. Then, the SFCs of these slices are embedded considering the infrastructure subgraph provided by the provisioning algorithm. The performance of this prov_emb approach is compared to a classical approach, direct_emb, where the SFCs are directly embedded in the infrastructure without prior provisioning. Two different resource provisioning schemes are considered. In the sequential approach (SN), resources are provisioned slice-by-slice, while in the joint approach (JN), provisioning is performed taking the constraints of all slices simultaneously and solving the resulting MILP, see (9)-(23). The ILP-based SFC embedding algorithm is adapted from [17] and [18].
1) Infrastructure Topology: As in [17, 37], a k-ary fattree infrastructure topology is considered, see Figure 8. The leaf nodes represent the RRHs. The other nodes represent the edge, regional, and central data centers. Infrastructure nodes and links provide a given amount of computing, storage, and possibly radio resources (ac, as, ar) expressed in available number of CPUs, Gbytes of available storage, and Gbps of transmission capacity, depending on the level they belong to. The cost of leasing each unit of infrastructure resource is set to 1.

Edge (4, 4, 0) 10

Fig. 8. Description of the k-ary fat-tree infrastructure network in case k = 4. Nodes provide a given amount of computing ac, storage as, and radio resource ar measured in number of used CPUs, Gbytes, and Gbps respectively. Links are assigned with a given amount of bandwidth ab measured in Gbps.

2) Slice Resource Demand (SRD): One considers a slice devoted to the delivery of HD video streaming services at 4 Mbps to 4000 users. Within the slice, each SFC to be deployed consists of three chained VNFs: a virtual Video Optimizer Controller (vVOC), a virtual Gateway (vGW) and a virtual BBU (vBBU). The minimum resource requirements for running each VNF instance correspond to the aggregated resource required by an SFC managing 200 users connected to a single virtual BS.
As detailed in Section III, the resource requirements for the various SFCs that will have to be deployed within a slice are aggregated within an SRD graph that mimics the graph of SFCs. SRD nodes and links are characterized by the aggregated resource needed to support the targeted number of users. Details of each resource type as well as associated SRD graph are given in Table III. Numerical values in Table III have been adapted from [35]. In the following, we consider multiple demands from different SPs for this type of slice.

3) Results: Figures 9a, 9b, and 9c illustrate respectively the infrastructure node utilization, the infrastructure link utilization, and the computing time for different number |S| of HD video streaming slices. Infrastructure node or link utilization reï¬‚ects the percentage of infrastructure nodes or links provisioned for the considered slices. The SN and JN approaches are compared.
Figure 9b shows that the joint provisioning scheme provides a slightly reduced node and link utilization compared to the sequential approach. The difference increases with the number of slices. Speciï¬cally, when |S| = 2, both methods give the same performance. When |S| = 3 and |S| = 4, the joint provisioning leads to a node and link usage reduced by 0.27% and 0.53%, compared to the sequential method.
Nevertheless, as can be seen in Figure 9c, the sequential provisioning method outperforms the joint approach in terms of computing time. As explained in Section IV-C, in the case of JN, the number of possible conï¬gurations to consider increases

PREPRINT

with the number of slices to deploy and therefore increases the computation duration.
Figures 10a and 10b show respectively the cost and the consumed computing time for different number of SFCs to be embedded (ranging from 2 to 10). The embedding cost reï¬‚ects the amount of infrastructure node and link resources used for embedding these SFCs. The proposed method, prov_emb, where provisioning is done before VNF embedding, has similar performance as a direct embedding (direct_emb) without prior provisioning. Nevertheless, as depicted in Figure 10b, the prov_emb approach is faster than direct_emb. The difference increases with the number of SFCs to embed. Note that in the prov_emb approach, the computing time for the provisioning step has been taken into account.
B. Accounting for coverage constraints
1) Infrastructure Topology: In this section, one accounts for coverage constraints. For that purpose, consider the 1.43 kmÃ—4.95 km area around the Stade de France in SeineSaint-Denis (suburban area of the city of Paris) shown in Figure 3. The map includes real coordinates of RRH nodes (indicated by blue markers) taken from the open database provided by the French National Agency of Frequencies1.
The k-ary fat-tree infrastructure topology considered in Section V-A is used here again. The amount of network infrastructure resource available at each node and link of the infrastructure remains the same. Only the RRH nodes are represented in Figure 3. The locations of the remaining parts of the infrastructure network (central, regional, and edge nodes) are not displayed.
2) Slice Resource Demand (SRD): We consider three types of slices:
â€¢ Slice 1 covers the Stade de France and aims to provide HD video streaming services at 4 Mbps for at most 500 VIP users within the stadium (downlink trafï¬c);
â€¢ Slice 2 is dedicated to provide an SD video streaming services at 0.5 Mbps, and covers the blue-highlighted area in Figure 3 (downlink trafï¬c);
â€¢ Slice 3 aims to provide video surveillance and trafï¬c monitoring service at 1 Mbps for 50 cameras installed on the A86 highway (uplink trafï¬c).
Similar to the slice used in Section V-A, the ï¬rst two slices address a video streaming service, and thus have the same function architecture with 3 virtual functions: a vVOC, a vGW, and a vBBU. The third slice consists of ï¬ve virtual functions: a vBBU, a vGW, a virtual Trafï¬c Monitor (vTM), a vVOC, and a virtual Intrusion Detection Prevention System (vIDPS).
The minimum resource requirements for running each VNF instance correspond to the aggregated resource required by an SFC managing 50, 600, and 5 users connected to a same virtual RRH, for Slice 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
The coverage area AÏƒ associated to each slice is partitioned into rectangular subareas AÏƒq of 89.58 mÃ—103.32 m.
Functional structure and resource requirements of three slices are described in Table IV.

3) Rate Function: Models bd xri, AÏƒq and bu xri, AÏƒq ,
introduced in Section IV-A, for the amount of data carried by a RB for a user located in AÏƒq and served by a RRH located in xri are now considered. Let d xri, AÏƒq be the distance between xri and the center of each rectangle AÏƒq . Focusing on downlink
trafï¬c, according to [38], one assumes that

bd xri, AÏƒq = Wi log2

1 + Prx,d d xri, AÏƒq Pn

, (26)

where Wi is the bandwidth (in Hz) of a RB provided by RRH i, Pn is the noise power given by Pn = WiN0, where N0 is the noise power spectral density. Prx(d) is the obtained signal power at the receiver evaluated as

Prx,d(d) = Ptx,d + Gtx,d + Grx,d âˆ’ P L(d),

(27)

where Ptx is the transmission power of the transmitter, Gtx and Grx are the antenna gains of the transmitter and the receiver, and P L(d) is the Path Loss given by the adapted Î±Î²Î³-model
introduced in [39] for 5G mobile network

P L(d) = 10Î± log10(d) + Î² + 10Î³ log10(fi), (28)
where Î± and Î³ are respectively coefï¬cients accounting for the dependency of the path loss with distance and frequency fi, Î² is an optimized offset value for path loss (dB). P L, d, and fi are expressed in dB, meters, and GHz, respectively. An expression similar to (26) may be derived for bu xri, AÏƒq .
All RRH i âˆˆ NIr and all UEs are assumed to be identical. The parameters for the models bd xri, AÏƒq and bu xri, AÏƒq are summarized in Table V and have been partly taken from [40].

4) Results: This section illustrates the performance of the the four variants of the provisioning algorithm described in Table II, when only Slices 1 and 2 have to be deployed and when all three slices have to be deployed.
Figures 11a, 11b illustrate respectively the wireless and wired cost related to the RP (radio resource provisioning) and the NP (other network resource provisioning) problems. First, we observe that the joint RP scheme yields the minimum radio and wired cost whatever the NP allocation method (JR_SN and

JR_JN). It also provides the minimum total provisioning cost, as shown in Figure 11c.
The use of radio resource blocks is depicted in Figure 11d. Again, one observes that the joint RP (JR_SN and JR_JN) outperforms the sequential approach (SR_JN and SR_SN), since the joint RP aims at ï¬nding the optimal solution for the whole problem, i.e., provisioning for all the slices, while the sequential method only accounts for the constraints of each slice sequentially. The joint RP approach also leads to an efï¬cient utilization of infrastructure nodes and links when solving the NP problem, as shown in Figures 11e and 11f. The difference in performance of these two sets of methods (JR_SN and JR_JN versus SR_SN and SR_JN) becomes more signiï¬cant when the three slices are simultaneously considered. For instance, with two slices, a difference of 4.17% in terms of link utilization is observed in favor of the JR_JN approach, see Figure 11f, whereas with three slices, the difference is 8.33%. Overall, the JR_JN approach provides the best performance in terms of deployment costs and resource usage among the four proposed methods.

Nevertheless, as expected, the methods involving sequen-

tial provisioning (SR and SN) perform better than the joint

approaches (JR and/or JN) in terms of computing time. In-

creasing of the number of slices leads to an increase of the

and therefore increases the computing time. In sequential

provisioning, slices are considered successively. Therefore, the

least and most time-consuming among the four methods, as

shown in Figure 12.

VI. CONCLUSIONS
This paper considers the problem of infrastructure resource provisioning for network slicing in future mobile networks. Contrary to previous best-effort approaches where SFCs are deployed sequentially in the infrastructure network, here infrastructure resources are provisioned to accommodate slice resource demands. For that purpose, a graph of Slice Resource Demands is deï¬ned. This graph describes the aggregated resource requirements of the SFCs that will be deployed by the MNO for a given slice. Radio coverage constraints, to ensure a minimum data rate for users in the geographical areas where services have to be deployed, as well as other constraints related to the infrastructure network are combined in an MILP problem formulation.
A two-step approach is proposed to address this problem. Resources on RRH are provisioned ï¬rst to ensure the satisfaction of the coverage constraints. Constraints as deï¬ned by the SRD graph are then considered. When resources have to be provisioned for several concurrent slices, two variants have again been considered. At each step, constraints related to each slice may be considered either sequentially, or jointly. Due to the exponential worst-case complexity in the number of variables of the MILP, as expected, sequential methods are shown, through simulation, to better scale to network topologies of realistic size. The price to be paid is a somewhat degraded

link utilization and a higher provisioning cost compared to
the joint approach.
Once resources have been provisioned, the approach intro-
duced in [17, 37] may be used to deploy SFCs, but considering
only a simpliï¬ed infrastructure network reduced to the nodes
and links which have provisioned resources. Simulations show
that provisioning and then deploying is more efï¬cient in terms
of computing time than direct SFC embedding.
Several issues will be addressed in future work. First, due
to the two-step approach, radio coverage constraints are taken
into account ï¬rst, which leads to the provisioning of RRH
resources. This provisioning may not be compliant with other
infrastructure network constraints. To address this issue, both
coverage and infrastructure network constraints have to be
really taken into account simultaneously. Alternatively, an
iterative approach has to be introduced to eliminate in the
ï¬rst provisioning step, the RRH provisioning schemes which
have been shown, in the second step, to lead to infrastructure
provisioning issues. Second, only static provisioning is con-
sidered in this paper. Adaptive provisioning techniques should
be proposed to cope with time-varying aggregated demands.
