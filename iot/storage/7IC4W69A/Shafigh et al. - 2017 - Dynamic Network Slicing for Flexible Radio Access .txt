Abstractâ€”Tactile Internet (TI) will generate a variety of 5G-enabled use cases with different requirements for latency, throughput and reliability. In this paper, we propose a ï¬‚exible cloud-based radio access network (FRAN) for TI, where trafï¬c of user equipments (UEs) can be temporary ofï¬‚oaded from the operator-provided networks to user-provided networks if needed. Such a concept enables dynamic network slicing (DNS) where the network architecture is temporally augmented with slices of infrastructure borrowed from user provided network. FRAN is able to support Tactile applications without any basic change to the hardware/software infrastructure in the network. We model DNS system as a two-layer/slice trafï¬c-aware resource allocation framework, where every layer uses a separate two-step matching game in order to serve Tactile users (TUs) and low-priority users (LUs). We propose a subgame Nash stable and two-sided exchange stable concepts as solutions of the proposed two-layer trafï¬c-aware resource allocation. Our numerical results show that network operators and UEs (either TUs or LUs) signiï¬cantly beneï¬t from deploying the FRAN rather than conventional cloudbased radio access networks (CRANs).

I. INTRODUCTION
Nowadays, wireless communication networks are largely focused towards latency tolerant trafï¬c with little attention to delay-sensitive trafï¬c e.g. Tactile Internet applications [1], [2]. In these systems, including Internet of things (IoT) applications, vehicular networks, smart grid, distributed robotics, and other cyber-physical systems, the requirements for latency could be two or three orders of magnitude more stringent than in traditional applications. Tactile Internet will provide a true paradigm shift from content-delivery to skill-set delivery networks, and thereby revolutionize almost every segment of the society [3], [4], [5], [6], [7].
In order to facilitate the emergence of such ultra lowlatency and high-reliability applications, this paper develops a novel cloud-based radio access network (CRAN) system [8], [9] as a new cloud architecture for future mobile network operators (MNOs). This ï¬‚exible cloud radio network (FRAN) for Tactile Internet (TI) adaptively uses user-provided

networks [10] to provide an efï¬cient framework for ultra low-latency communications. In user-provided networks, users share their connectivity and act as access points for other users and so increase the network capacity. DNS is capable to instantly ofï¬‚oad current low-priority users (LUs) to userprovided networks and reassign resources to high priority Tactile users (TUs). Incentive and pricing mechanisms have attracted intensive research to motivate users to share their connectivity and establish a dynamic network architecture (DNA) [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. Here, we further extend DNA concept to make the access network more ï¬‚exible and self-adjustable to trafï¬c density variations.
The main contributions of our paper are as follows:
â€“ A ï¬‚exible radio access network (FRAN) , based on DNS, optimized for Tactile Internet by combining DNA and CRAN concepts.
â€“ A two-step matching game for trafï¬c-aware resource allocation in FRAN with DNS.
â€“ Load balancing and ofï¬‚oading techniques to support ï¬‚exibility concept of FRAN.
â€“ Two-sided exchange-stable and Nash stability concepts as solutions of the resource allocation in FRAN.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the system model. In Section III, the two-layer trafï¬caware resource allocation problem is presented while Section IV presents the numerical results. Finally, Section V concludes the paper.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
We consider a ï¬‚exible cloud radio access network (FRAN) system based on DNS for Tactile Internet (TI) with B remote radio heads (RRHs) denoted by the set B, which are used to serve I user equipments (UEs) denoted by the set I. We indicate by K the set of available physical resource blocks (PRBs), which are assigned by the baseband unit (BBU) to B RRHs in the system shown in Fig.1. Furthermore, there are J user-provided access points strengthening the proposed system by offering available resources to their vicinity low-priority users (LUs). The user-provided dynamic access points (DAPs) J are user devices motivated by operators to share their unused resources. Such dynamic network architecture (DNA)

Here, we denote by R = {r|r âˆˆ J âˆª B} the set of both RRHs and DAPs.

two kinds of slices are deï¬ned as follow: 1) High-Throughput Slice (HTS): LUs prefer to be assigned
to the nearest access point either RRH or DAP to achieve the maximum possible throughput with power efï¬ciency. Therefore, they can rank available DAP and RRHs in order to create a dynamic slice according to the provided throughput. For every UE i and AP r âˆˆ J âˆª B belonging to a slice, capacity of link (i,r) is calculated as

b âˆˆ B, k âˆˆ K,

(2)

where Ï„iA,b and Ï„bF,k represent access and fronthaul delays of UE i served by RRH b and BBU k in the access and fronthaul networks respectively. Here, we assume that every UE i has an arrival rate Î»i. Furthermore, propagation delay of fronthaul due to using high speed communication links is negligible. Thus, the access delay of every UE i associated with RRH b
can be calculated as

where Îºb represents service rate of RRH b. In the BBU pool, every RRH is associated at most to one BBU which can serve more than one RRH (many-to-one association). Therefore, delay of a given RRH b that is served by a BBU k can be calculated as

where Îºk and Î»b represent the service rate of k âˆˆ K and arrival rate of b âˆˆ B respectively. In the above, Bk is the subset of RRHs assigned to BBU k. In the proposed trafï¬caware resource allocation process, if current resources are not enough for providing required QoS of TUs, some LUs would be ofï¬‚oaded to DNA networks. Furthermore, the fronthaul network can be adapted by load balancing to avoid allocating overloaded BBUs to the incoming TUs.

C. Utility and Proï¬t Functions

Future network operators with Tactile services would be able to provide ultra low-latency communications for UEs. Based on the network condition, LUs might be ofï¬‚oaded to DNA networks by offering some incentives. This ofï¬‚oading process imposes extra cost to the operator. For every ofï¬‚oaded UE, a new network slice is created over DNA. Therefore, proï¬t function of NO, which includes cost of ofï¬‚oading and gains from TUs and LUs, is given as

where the ï¬rst and second terms represent the beneï¬t of the NO from serving TUs and LUs respectively. The ofï¬‚oading procedure imposes the cost Ï‘ Ã— |IDLNA| to the operator, where Ï‘ and IDLNA âŠ‚ I are the ofï¬‚oading cost and the list of accepted LUs for ofï¬‚oading by DNA network respectively. Therefore, every network operator should decide about the number of LUs to be ofï¬‚oaded to DNA networks in order to meet the requirements of TUs.
In UEâ€™s side, we model satisfaction of TUs with a utility function given as

Existing pricing and incentives mechanisms in DNA [10], [16], [17] can be easily extended to motivate access points to cooperate in FRAN to build up an extra slice in the network.

III. TWO-LAYER TRAFFIC-AWARE RESOURCE ALLOCATION IN FRAN
We develop a framework to assign user and operatorprovided resources (e.g. link capacity) to TUs and LUs in such a way that all players (network operators and UEs) meet their requirements. Network operator optimizes resource utilization ratio while UEs have their own quality of service requirements. Here, the proposed trafï¬c-aware resource allocation (See Fig.2) consists of two different layers for TUs and LUs. In the ï¬rst layer (high priority slice), TUs are assigned to RRHs and RRHs to BBUs in access and fronthaul networks respectively. In the second layer (low priority layer), LUs are associated to DAPs&RRHs and RRHs to BBUs through ofï¬‚oading and load balancing techniques in access and fronthaul networks respectively. If the delay of a typical TU is higher than its requirement, load balancing technique is used to rearrange the allocation scheme in fronthaul network. If it fails, active LUs are blocked (ofï¬‚oaded from the FRAN to DNA) to reduce the experienced-delay by the TUs.
In the proposed model, the efï¬ciency of Tactile layer (TL) signiï¬cantly depends on low-priority-layer (LL) which is a function of the pricing and incentive mechanisms of operator. Effective pricing and incentive mechanisms can motivate DAPs to participate in the resource sharing process. According

to Fig.1, unsatisï¬ed DAPs do not participate in ofï¬‚oading

A. Centralized Matching Game Model for Each Layer in FRAN
We develop two separate two-step matching games [18] in response to TI request for low-latency communications (Low-Latency Slice) that requires to be served immediately (See Fig.3) and tolerant LUs request for high-throughput communications (High-Througput Slice), which can be also provided by DNA networks (See Fig.4). In the proposed game, shown in Fig.2, there are four different matching games. For the access networks of TL and LL layers, two one-toone sub-matching games TA-MG and LA-MG are deï¬ned between (TUs, RRHs) and (LUs, DAPs&RRHs) respectively. In the fronthaul network, two many-to-one matching games are deï¬ned between (RRHs, BBUs) in both layers. The only difference in the proposed many-to-one matching games is the type of UEs being served. We call many-to-one matching games in fronthaul network of TL and LL layers as TFMG and LF-MG respectively. Therefore, Tactile and highthroughput slices consist of (TA-MG, TF-MG) and (LA-MG, LF-MG) matching games respectively.
Deï¬nition 1. A high-priority Tactile Layer (low-latency slice) matching game (TL-MG) is a matching function Î· deï¬ned over IT Ã— B Ã— K such that |Î·(i)| = 1, |Î·(k)| = rk and |Î·(b)| = 1, where Î·(i) = {(b, k) âˆˆ B Ã— K|(i, b, k) âˆˆ Î·}, Î·(b) = {(i, k) âˆˆ IT Ã— K|(i, b, k) âˆˆ Î·}, Î·(k) = {(i, b) âˆˆ IT Ã— B|(i, b, k) âˆˆ Î·} and rk is the number of RRHs assigned to BBU k.
Thus, outcome of TL-MG is a matching function Î· providing the best possible low-latency communications (LLCs) for TUs such that âˆ€i âˆˆ IT , Ï„i <= Ï„ith and Ci â‰¥ Î“tih. According to the proposed framework, TUs are served ï¬rst by FRAN (operator-provided resources) and then LUs are decided to associated with either DNA or FRAN without harming TUs. TL-MG uses a load balancing mechanism in the fronthaul network to optimize the performance of TUs.
The LL layer (high-throughput slice) is used to enhance resource allocation efï¬ciency by ofï¬‚oading and load balancing techniques. The general low-priority layer matching game shown in Fig.4 is deï¬ned as
Deï¬nition 2. A low-priority layer matching game (LL-MG) is a matching function Âµ[Î·] deï¬ned over IL Ã— R[Î·] Ã— K[Î·] such that |Âµ(i)| = 1, |Âµ(k)| = rk and |Âµ(r)| = 1, where Âµ(i) = {(r, k) âˆˆ R[Î·] Ã— K[Î·]|(i, r, k) âˆˆ Âµ}, Âµ(r) = {(i, k) âˆˆ ILÃ—K[Î·]|(i, r, k) âˆˆ Âµ}, Âµ(k) = {(i, r) âˆˆ ILÃ—R[Î·]|(i, r, k) âˆˆ Âµ}, rk is the number of RRHs assigned to BBU k and operand [.] denotes the current matching function of TL-MG.
Thus, still under LL-MG, Ï„i <= Ï„ith and Ci â‰¥ Î“tih, âˆ€i âˆˆ I.The outcomes of TL-MG and LL-MG are matching functions Î· and Âµ for jointly associating (TUs, LUs) to (RRHs, RRHs&DAPS) and RRHs to BBUs in different slices (See Fig.2).

According to the proposed network slicing model, the preferences of a player depend on other playersâ€™ choices having an impact on cochannel interference in the access network and delay in the fronthaul network. These externalities may degrade the performance of players especially TUs which need very low-latency communications. These externalities should be addressed in the sub-games in order to reach a stable matching as a solution of both TL-MG and LL-MG games. To deal with this challenge we look at a new stability concept based on the idea of swap-matching [19]. In a swap-matching, the set of players that beneï¬t from changing their current matching is called a blocking set.

Deï¬nition 3. Su is a blocking set of current matching if and only if there exist a pair of UEs belonging to Su that prefer to switch their DAPs/RRHs while keeping all other UEsâ€™ associations the same. For RRHs, Sr is a blocking set of RRHs if and only if there exist a pair of RRHs belonging to Sr that prefer to switch their BBUs while keeping all other RRHsâ€™ associations the same.

According to the deï¬nition of blocking sets, in the access and fronthaul matching, a matching is stable if does not exist any blocking set. Here, we need a new stability concept with assumption that all players in a blocking set must approve the swap matching. A BBU serving a critical TU may not accept another user if accepting the new user degrades the performance of the TU. Therefore, we introduce a new stability concept [19] as two-sided exchange-stable (TSES) matching deï¬ned as

Theorem 1. A matching Ïˆ âˆˆ {Î·, Âµ} is two-sided exchangestable (TSES) if and only if there is not any pair of either UEs (i, i ), âˆ€i, i âˆˆ I or pair of RRHs (r, r ), âˆ€r, r âˆˆ R such that in access/fronthaul matching game(AMG/FMG):

(a) âˆ€q âˆˆ {x, x , Ïˆ(x), Ïˆ (x )} Ï€q(Ïˆ ) â‰¥ Ï€q(Ïˆ), and

Proof. As mentioned before, existence of at least one blocking set can harm the stability of a matching game. According to the conditions (a) and (b) in (8), all blocking members approve the swapping operation if only if they do not loose any proï¬t, otherwise the set can not reach the stability.

B. Decomposing Centralized Matching Games into Two-Sided Exchange-Stable Matching (TSES)

Due to the rationality of players and their strict require-

ments, we deï¬ne a Nash stability concept for TL-MG and LL-

MG games by introducing a sub-Nash stable (SNS) concept

for sub-games. Nash stable provides a suitable framework for

players with strict requirements in the proposed trafï¬c-aware

resource allocation mechanism.

1) Sub-game Nash stability for AMGs: We deï¬ne prefer-

ence relations and over the sets of B and I so that players

i

b

in I and B are able to rank each other respectively.

Lemma 1. A strategy Î·Aâˆ— for TA-MG is called a SNS, if âˆ€i, i âˆˆ IT and âˆ€b, b âˆˆ B, there is not any player in {i, i , b, b } who can beneï¬t from moving current matching Î·Aâˆ— to another matching Î·A. In other words, the following condition always hold âˆ€Î·A âˆˆ Î·Â¯A:
(a) (i/b, Î·Aâˆ— ) (i /b , Î·A) â†” Ï€b/i(Î·Aâˆ— ) â‰¥ Ï€b/i(Î·A),
b/i
(b) (i/b, Î·Aâˆ— ) (i /b , Î·A) â†” Ï€b/i(Î·Aâˆ— ) > Ï€b/i(Î·A), (9)
b/i

where Î·Â¯A is the set of possible TSES matching for TA-MG.

Proof. The ï¬rst condition implies that player b or i prefers Î·Aâˆ— to Î·A âˆˆ Î·Â¯A since it gains beneï¬t or at least its utility remains the same in the worse case scenario. The second
condition denotes that at least one of the players in {i, i , b, b } beneï¬t from Î·Aâˆ— . So, each condition assures that Î·Aâˆ— is a SNS, otherwise at least one of the condition does not hold.

Solving the matching games TL-MG and LL-MG in their original form is complicated and impractical. Here, we are looking for a distributed resource allocation algorithm for self-organizing and autonomous players. We decompose the original matching games TL-MG and LL-MG into access and fronthaul sub-matching games, AMG and FMG respectively. Then, we use an iterative algorithm to ï¬nd TSES matching in these sub-games (See Fig.2).
Due to the requirements of TUs, their resource allocation process is independent from LUs. Thus, we propose two different resource allocation algorithms for serving TUs and LUs. However their resource allocation procedure is almost the same especially in the FMG, where RRHs are assigned to BBUs. The main difference between these two mechanisms in TL and LL layers is that DAPs are excluded from the access network in TL. It is reasonable because the network should provide strict constraints for TUs. Every DAP j has its own Internet connection, processing and storage capacities but its intermittent availability is unsuitable to guarantee any QoS level for Tactile users.
In order to ï¬nd a stable matching for TL-MG/LL-MG, we can use the following Theorem.
Theorem 2. A matching result of (TL-MG, LL-MG) is TSES if their sub-matching games (TA-MG, LA-MG) in the access and (TF-MG, LF-MG) in fronthaul networks are TSES respectively.
Proof. The proof is straightforward. If one of the sub-games is not in its TSES state, it means that there is at least one blocking set in the matching.

For LA-MG which is a matching game for ofï¬‚oading technique, we have the following Lemma for SNS:
Lemma 2. A strategy Âµâˆ—A for LA-MG is called a SNS, if âˆ€i, i âˆˆ IL, âˆ€r, r âˆˆ R, there is not any player in {i, i , r, r } who can beneï¬t from moving his current matching Âµâˆ—A to another matching ÂµA. In other words, the following condition always hold âˆ€ÂµA âˆˆ ÂµÂ¯A:
(a) (i/r, Âµâˆ—A) (i /r , ÂµA) â†” Ï€r/i(Âµâˆ—A) â‰¥ Ï€r/i(ÂµA),
r/i
(b) (i/r, Âµâˆ—A) (i /r , ÂµA) â†” Ï€r/i(Âµâˆ—A) > Ï€r/i(ÂµA), (10)
r/i
where ÂµÂ¯A is the set of possible TSES matching for LA-MG.
Proof. Proof is straightforward.
The above Lemma implies that LU are ofï¬‚oaded according to the current matching function of TA-MG.
2) Sub-game Nash Stability for FMGs: We deï¬ne a preference relation over the set of B so that players (BBUs)
k
are able to rank RRHs. Here, we deï¬ne load balancing submatching games (TF-MG and LF-MG) in both layers as:
Lemma 3. A strategy (Âµâˆ—F /Î·Fâˆ— ) is called a SNS for LF-MG/TF-MG, âˆ€k, k âˆˆ K and âˆ€b, b âˆˆ B, if there is not any player in {b, b , k, k } who can beneï¬t from moving his current matching Âµâˆ—F /Î·Fâˆ— to another matching ÂµF /Î·F .
(a) (b, Âµâˆ—F /Î·Fâˆ— ) (b , ÂµF /Î·F ) â†” Ï€k(Âµâˆ—F /Î·Fâˆ— ) â‰¥ Ï€k(ÂµF /Î·F ),
k
(b) (k, Âµâˆ—F /Î·Fâˆ— ) (k , ÂµF /Î·F ) â†” Ï€b(Âµâˆ—F /Î·Fâˆ— ) > Ï€b(ÂµF /Î·F ),

Proof. If one of the sub-games is not Nash stable, at least one of players can improve its beneï¬t by blocking current matching result. Thus, LF-MG/TL-MG is Nash stable if only if both sub-games are Nash stable.
Thus, we ï¬nd a Nash stable by iteratively ï¬nding SNSs for sub-games. Notice that we use a SNS of one sub-game as an input for the another sub-match game. For example, we use Âµâˆ—A in AMG as initial state of FMG and ï¬nd Âµâˆ—F , which is used as initial state of AMG in the next iteration. This procedure continues until it converges. We propose Algorithm 1 to ï¬nd a Nash stable matching for LL-MG/TL-MG. This algorithm consists of two parts, which belong to access matching game (AMG) and fronthaul matching game (FMG). In AMG for LL layer, Âµ(At) is updated based on (Âµ(Ft), Î·F(t)) while Î·A(t) is updated based on Î·F(t) in TL layer. This means that LUs assignment should be done precisely without harming TUs.
First, we run Algorithm 1 for Tactile slices to ï¬nd Nash stable for Tactile users independent of LUs. Then, we run Algorithm 1 for LUs such that TUs still meet their requirements.
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, we present numerical results to validate the theoretical analysis of the previous sections and provide some further insights into the operation of two-layer trafï¬c-aware resource allocation model. In the analysis we use random network topology with parameters from Table I.
Fig. 5 presents the utility of UEs versus the number of iterations with the number of TUs and LUs as parameters. According to the achieved results, the proposed algorithm requires at least 10 iterations to reach Nash stability in Tactile

layer (marker 1). Next, LUs use load-balancing and ofï¬‚oading techniques to reach Nash stability in the high-throughput network with about 20 iterations. As expected, increasing of the number of TUs can signiï¬cantly reduce the average utility of other users.
Fig. 6 shows the average utility versus the number of DAPs with the number of TUs and LUs as parameters. Introducing more DAPs into the FRAN system results in a signiï¬cant increase in the utility of LUs since DNA can only handle LUs. By increasing the number of DAPs from 2 to 20 the average utility of LUs is improved by factors between 3 and 6. There is also an improvement in TUsâ€™ utility due to the reduction of trafï¬c load by ofï¬‚oading LUs. DNA can enhance TUsâ€™ utility at least 15% by introducing DAPs.
Fig. 7 presents the running time of the proposed algorithm versus the number of LUs with the number of DAPs as parameters. According to the achieved results, the running time of the algorithm is less than 40 ms for allocating resources to the both layers while the resource allocation for Tactile users takes less than 10 ms in order to satisfy the requirements of Tactile applications.
V. CONCLUSION
This paper proposes a ï¬‚exible framework networking called FRAN based on using DNA networking paradigm for dynamic network slicing for Tactile Internet applications. In this kind

dynamically current networks for supporting Tactile Internet applications without any extra investment into infrastructure.
As possible extensions of this work, we are planning to consider terminals equipped with multiple antennas and develop beam forming schemes to select the most appropriate APs that satisfy the QoS requirements and maximize throughput.

of networking model, operators motivate users to share their resources instead of installing costly hardware/software infrastructure equipment everywhere. A key contribution of our paper is two-step matching game model for the proposed twolayer trafï¬c-aware resource allocation mechanism in which load balancing and ofï¬‚oading techniques are used to improve the performance of FRAN. As a solution for such a model we have developed two-sided exchange-stable and Nash stability concepts. Our numerical results indicate that combining DNA and CRAN is an efï¬cient networking model to extend
