Sensors
A sensor is a transducer whose purpose is to sense or detect a characteristic of its environment, providing a corresponding output, generally as an electrical or optical signal, related to the quantity of the measured variable.
examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics

examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics

Analogue sensors
Analogue sensors typically require being connected to an ADC (Analogue to Digital Converter) to translate the analogue (continuous) reading to an equivalent digital value in millivolts.

The quality and resolution of the measure depends on both the ADC resolution (10-12 bits in the Z1 and RE-Mote) and the sampling frequency. As a rule of thumb, the sampling frequency must be at least twice that of the phenomenon you are measuring. i.e human speech (which may contain frequencies up to 8 kHz), sample at 16 kHz.
examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics

The ADC provides a count value (the analogue sensor quantized value). Depending on the sensor we may want to use the count value, or its equivalent voltage value.

The higher the resolution, higher the sampling time and the size of the value.
The accuracy and required resolution helps to choose the number of required bits to quantized

examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics

Normally the conversion formula (to obtain the actual measuring units, i.e lux or celsius from the voltage value) are provided by the sensor manufacturer. In other cases, it is required to obtain by measuring and correlating with another calibrated source. Depending on the accuracy on the sensor, we would either use actual units (i.e 1024 lux), or just characterize thresholds (i.e dark, bright). For the later, using a cheap sensor might be enough for the application requirements.

Digital sensors
A digital sensor is an electronic or electrochemical sensor, where data conversion and transmission are done digitally. Digital sensors are normally interfaced over a digital communication protocol such as I2C, SPI, 1-Wire, Serial or depending on the manufacturer, a proprietary protocol normally on a ticking clock.
examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics

The default configuration matches the I2C, but it can be reconfigured as SPI, even UART. Pins in the ARM Cortex-M3 CC2538 can be multiplexed to different controllers
examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics

Digital sensors allow a more extended set of commands (turn on, turn off, configure interrupts, resolution, etc). With a digital light sensor for example, you could set a threshold value and let the sensor send an interrupt when reached, without the need for continuous polling. Remember to check the specific sensor information and data sheet for more information.
examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics

Sensors in Contiki
Contiki defines a common API to implement and use both sensors and actuators. Normally platform-specific sensor implementations are located in the platform‚Äôs /dev folder. Contiki has ADC, I2C, SPI and UART libraries, normally sensor and actuators implementations use these, so the porting effort is greatly minimized.

The light sensor is covered Voltage: 0.0064-0.021V, in dark environments the sensor resistance is up to 1M‚Ñ¶, so the voltaje will decrease as shown

examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics/06-adc.c

Light sensor with no cover. Voltage: 2.10-2.08V, in light environments the resistance of the sensor decreases (20K‚Ñ¶ and lower), so the voltage will be higher as shown

examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics/06-adc.c

As we have voltage values we need the actual ADC count, for the 0.21V (dark):

Exponential and logarithms are processing-expensive operations.
Instead of calculating the lux values, one could use the correlated voltage or ADC count value in the application (to trigger an alarm if the room is dark), or send over the radio the ADC count and let the remote server/application to do the math

Actuators
An actuator is a device that allow us to interact with the physical world, and change the state of a given variable. A light switch turns a light bulb on and off, an electrovalve can control the flow of water, an electronic lock can open or shut a door
examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics

General Input/Output Pins (GPIO)
The General input/output pins are generic pins used either as input or output (0-3.3V), useful in case you need to actuate on something, or read the digital voltage level as high/low (3.3V or 0V). Normally the electrovalves, relays, switchs are bi-state, so a GPIO pin can be used to control. The LEDs are driven by GPIOs configured as output, changing its value from high/low turns the LEDs on/off (depending if used a pull-up or pulldown resistors). The user button previously shown is a GPIO configured as input, when pressed its value changed, and its status is read by the MCU.

Each PORT has 8 PINs, numbered from 0-7 PA5 then is the PIN number 6 in PORT A
examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics

examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics

GPIOs in a PORT can be accessed via masks, as each PORT has 8 pins, it is similar to an 8-bit variable

In binary

: 00010100

In hexadecimal : 0x14

In decimal

: 20

If this were the pins in PORT B, it would mean PA2 and PA4 can be configured in a single operation

examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics

PIN 3 mask value would be (1 << 3), the equivalent to 8 examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics

examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics/07-gpio.c

Change the value of the PIN in the example, and toggle the LED3 (see in the previous slides which PORT/PIN values corresponds to it) If available, use a multimeter to measure the voltage values in the pins when high and low. If available, connect a relay and try to turn on and off a lamp
