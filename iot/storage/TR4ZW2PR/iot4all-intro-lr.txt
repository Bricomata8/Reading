3rd issue: finding the information you need
q Searching for information is a tough issue
q Web search engine: Google,…
q Most IoT clouds uses HTTP request (GET, POST, PUT, …) to push/store data to web platforms/servers
q If you need an information, for instance the temperature in room A of HiveColab in Kampala, then you have to go to the right web page
q When there can be millions of IoT nodes providing large variety of data, it is difficult to find your way!
27

From search for info to get the info
q Use the PUBLISH/SUBSCRIBE model

4th issue: make it simpler?
q End-users are not necessarily computer science experts nor high-skilled programmers
q Use graphical tools to build data processing flows, allowing intuivive connection from data producers to data consumers
31

Node-Red
q Node-RED is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services, e.g. clouds of various types
q provides a browser-based flow editor to wire together flows with a wide range of nodes
32

Node-red enabled IoT gateway
q Messages received on the IoT gateway can be injected into a Node-Red flow, allowing complex data processing to be defined

The IoT BackOffice

IoT usually means
36

But also how to analyse the data
q What is the meaning of the collected data? q Example with farming
q What is interesting for farmers?
• Fertility detection • Eating/Ruminating time for welfare
q What data can be easily obtained?
• accelerometer data with neck-mounted collar
q How to detect relevant event from these data?
Advanced data analysis
Need of experts from the domain!
37

Analysis techniques
q Traditional statistic methods still valid, and useful!
