Slicing the Edge: Resource Allocation for RAN Network Slicing
Phuong Luu Vo, Minh N. H. Nguyen, Tuan Anh Le, Nguyen H. Tran, Member, IEEE

Abstractâ€”Network slicing is considered to be a crucial feature of 5G cellular system. By dividing the network infrastructure into multiple logical segments, network slicing can support parallel services with different requirements. While technology developments focus on slicing the core networks, there are limited studies in network slicing for radio access networks (RAN). Hence, in this work, we study the RAN slicing and slice coordination, which is formulated as a bi-convex problem. Even though there are complicated couplings between the RAN resource allocation for each slice and the coordination of the slices that share the same resources, we design two algorithms addressing these couplings of this bi-convex problem. Simulation results validate the efï¬cacy of our proposed algorithms.
I. INTRODUCTION
Network slicing is emerging as one of the key elements to enable the ï¬fth generation (5G) cellular networks. Specifically, with network slicing, the network infrastructure can be segmented into multiple logical network slices to support various services with different requirements. For example, one network slice is dedicated to augmented reality applications with ultra-reliable and low-latency communications, whereas another slice is designated for extremely high throughput video-on-demand services. With those beneï¬ts, network slicing has attracted interest from various mobile operators, e.g., SK Telecom and Ericsson demonstrated how network slices were created to support augmented reality in 2015 whereas Ericsson and NTT DoCoMo provided a dynamic network slicing proof-of-concept for 5G core networks in 2016 [1].
Recently, a number of comprehensive surveys have discussed different 5G network slicing architectures and its applications, including vehicular networks, information-centric networks, isolated wireless network slicing, etc., [2]â€“[5]. However, these works do not consider the problems of slice allocation and coordination, which are equally important to bring network slicing into fruition. Thus, in this work, we propose slicing algorithms that can perform radio access network (RAN) slicing (including base station (BS) bandwidth, caching, and backhaul capacties) and handle the coordination between these slices. While BS radio bandwidth is inarguably a critical resource of RAN, in 5G cellular system, caching

and backhaul will play important roles because i) the backhaul link will be bottlenecked due to 5G network densiï¬cation, and ii) caching at BS can reduce the trafï¬c to the core network. However, cache storage and backhaul link are mostly ignored in RAN slicing. Furthermore, in order to support a wide range of segmented services, the coordination of all created slices to optimize the aggregated slice performance is also a critical issue, which is, unexpectedly, under-explored.
We see that none of the existing works consider the RAN slicing of jointly BS radio bandwidth, caching, and backhaul components. This creates a unique challenge: how to allocate and coordinate multiple RAN slices for tenants such that the aggregated load of all allocated slices and the backhaul delay are minimized, considering each physical resource has its own capacity constraint. This challenge imposes two interdependences: while the ï¬rst one is between the BS radio bandwidth and caching slice allocation to minimize the aggregate BS slice load, the second one is between the caching and backhaul slice allocation to minimize the aggregate backhaul delay.
By tackling these challenges, our contributions can be summarized as follows:
â€¢ We ï¬rst formulate a network slicing design as an optimization problem, which is further shown to be a biconvex problem, that accounts for both RAN vertical slicing and slice coordination issues. To solve this problem, we propose two alternative minimization algorithms for this bi-convex problem. While the ï¬rst is a centralized scheme that can be supported by 5G network virtualization and orchestration tools [2], the second one is a distributed approach where all slices coordinate to reach the solution.
â€¢ Even though our alternative minimization approaches have no global convergence guarantee, simulation results show that they can achieve a global optimal solution (compared with exhaustive search) in a simple scenario with two tenants. When the number of tenants is increased, the results show that our algorithms can converge to the same performance as that of IpOPt solver, validating the efï¬cacy of our proposed approaches.

Fig. 1: A RAN network slicing model with three tenants.

These network resources will be â€œslicedâ€ according to the
demand of each tenant. Speciï¬cally, we deï¬ne a slice allocated
to a tenant n by a tuple (Î±n, Î²n, Î³n), which is a fraction of (W, S, B), respectively, such that nâˆˆN Î±n = nâˆˆN Î²n =
nâˆˆN Î³n = 1. We denote the vector (Î±n)nâˆˆN by Î±, similarly for Î² and Î³.
Each tenant n has its own set of users Un. Users of all tenants request the contents from a catalog with a set F of contents with equal size L1. Furthermore, for a tenant n with
its user un âˆˆ Un, content access pattern of un is modeled by a distribution pun,f such that fâˆˆF pun,f = 1, âˆ€un âˆˆ Un.
We consider a timeslot model where slicing decision is
updated according to the demand of tenantsâ€™ users (e.g., 10
minutes). In one timeslot, the tenant nâ€™s user request rate for
contents is denoted by Î»un , âˆ€un âˆˆ Un.

B. Cache Slicing

According to [6], by using the reset time-to-live (TTL) cache model, the hit probability of content f of tenant n is

h = 1 âˆ’ e n,f

âˆ’ unâˆˆUn Î»un,f Tn,f

(1)

where Î»un,f := pun,f Î»un , and Tn,f is the characteristic time of content f of tenant n, which can be considered as timer in TTL caching. Because the expected number of contents of a tenant must not exceed its allocated cached capacity, we have

fâˆˆF hn,f = Î²nS, âˆ€n âˆˆ N .

(2)

Since the number of contents is very large, the request rate to

each content of tenant n can be small. Thus, we approximately

have

hn,f =

unâˆˆUn Î»un,f Tn,f , âˆ€n âˆˆ N ,

(3)

since eâˆ’x = 1 âˆ’ x when x is small enough.

Tenants usually have no content discrimination; thus, all of

their contents have the same characteristic time: Tn,f = Tn,

âˆ€f . Therefore, from (2) and (3), we have

hn,f =

unâˆˆUn Î»un,f Î» unâˆˆUn un

Î²nS,

âˆ€n âˆˆ N .

(4)

There are two implications from (4): i) the hit probability

of each content increases when the cache space increases,

and ii) the hit probability is proportional to the request rate.

Furthermore, the content with a higher request rate (i.e., more

popular) has a higher hit probability.

1Heterogeneous content sizes can be divided into multiple content chunks with the same size.

C. BS Bandwidth Slicing
When the tenant n receives its BS slicing Î±n, the BS bandwidth it receives is Î±nW . With this bandwidth, the downlink rate of a tenant nâ€™s user is as follows

cun = Î±nW log(1 + SN Run ), âˆ€un âˆˆ Un,

(5)

where SN Run is user unâ€™s received signal-to-noise ratio. The SN Run can be given as

SN Run

=

gun Pun Ïƒu2n + Iun

,

(6)

where gun captures the channel gain (i.e., path loss, shadow-
ing, etc.) from the BS to the location of user un, Pun is the BS transmission power, Ïƒu2n denotes the background noise, and Iun denotes the other average interference sources (e.g.,
coming from neighboring BSs) seen by user un. We assume
that all users of tenant n will be scheduled in a time-shared

manner (e.g., TDMA) so there is no inter-user interference.

From (4), the hit rate and missed rate of the user un are deï¬ned respectively as follows

Î»huint =

f Î»un,f hn,f =

f Î»un,f

unâˆˆUn Î»un,f Î» unâˆˆUn un

Î²nS

(7)

Î»m unis = Î»un âˆ’ Î»huint, âˆ€un âˆˆ Un.

(8)

When a request to a content f of tenant n is hit (i.e., the content is found in the cache storage), this request can be served by the BS slice of tenant n immediately. Therefore, the load of the BS slice n is

Ïn(Î±n, Î²n) =

Î»huint , Âµ unâˆˆUn un

(9)

where Âµun = cun /L is the service rate of user unâ€™s content. D. Backhaul Capacity Slicing

When the requests are missed, they will be forwarded to the content server and downloaded through the backhaul link. Given the backhaul capacity slice Î³nB, the backhaul linkâ€™s delay cost of the tenant n is modeled by using M/M/1 queueing delay [7] as follows

Î¦n(Î²n, Î³n) :=

, Î»m n is
Âµm n isâˆ’Î»m n is
âˆ,

0 â‰¤ Î»m n is < Âµm n is; otherwise,

(10)

where Î»m n is := unâˆˆUn Î»m unis, and Âµm n is = Î³nB/L is the backhaul service rate for tenant n.

III. RAN NETWORK SLICING
In this section, we ï¬rst formulate the RAN slicing problem, then propose two algorithms for this problem.

In this problem, the objective is to minimize two components:

i) the aggregated BS slice load for load-balancing, and ii)

the backhaul link cost of all slices for delay minimization,

where Ï‰ is a weight factor which characterizes the Pareto

optimal values of these two objectives. This objective captures

two interdependences i) between the BS radio bandwidth and

caching slice allocation to minimize the aggregate slice load,

and ii) between the caching and backhaul slice allocation to

minimize the aggregate backhaul delay. Constraint (13) pre-

vents an over-loaded tenantâ€™s BS slice with a pre-determined

threshold .

We see that

to collect all information of tenants. When the tenant private information, e.g., hit/miss rates, is unobtainable, a decentralized scheme is needed to implement the RAN network slicing problem (11).
2) Decentralized Approach: We next design a decentralized algorithm based on the Jacobi-Proximal Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (JP-ADMM) method in [9]. Although there are several decentralized optimization algorithms such as dual decomposition and ADMM, we adopt this JP-ADMM method, which is a variant of ADMM, because it i) converges faster than dual decomposition method, and ii) exploits the parallelized structure of subproblem [9].
At each iteration k, given the announced dual variables (u(1k), u(2k), u(3k)) and aggregated values nâˆˆN Î²n(k),
nâˆˆN Î±n(k), nâˆˆN Î³n(k) of previous iteration, at the ï¬rst step, each tenant n only needs to solve its own problem as follow: First, each tenant n updates Î²n(k+1) by solving

The ï¬rst algorithm is centralized. This is inspired by the emerging software-deï¬ned network orchestration tools which can maintain a global state information to centrally implement network slicing [2].
1) Centralized Approach: We adopt the Proximal Block Coordinate Descent (PBCD) method presented in [8] for solving a general multi-convex problem.
At each iteration indexed by k, given the previously achieved Î±(k) and Î³(k), a controller will solve the following convex problem to obtain Î²(k+1) as follows

of two tenants and four tenants, in which the cache capacity (number of ï¬les) and backhaul capacity (Mbps) are 220 and 800 for the ï¬rst scenario, and 220 and 1200 for the second scenario, respectively. We use Julia to implement our proposed algorithms.
Even though our proposed algorithms does not theoretically guarantee the global optimum for the bi-convex problem (11), Fig. 2 shows that both algorithms can numerically converge to a tenantâ€™s global optimal cost, compared with an exhaustive search and IpOpt solver in a simple scenario of two tenants. In the second scenario with four tenants, since exhaustive search is impractical in this case, we compare the total cost convergence of the proposed schemes with that of IpOpt in the lower plot of Fig. 2, which shows that all have the same convergent value. Also, the convergence of BS, cache, and backhaul slicing is shown in Fig. 5. We see that Tenant 1 and 4 with higher trafï¬c demands use most of the BS and cache capacities while the remaining tenants will get contents via backhaul link by using 38% and 44% backhaul capacity. Although Tenant 1 receives 46% and 49% of BS and cache capacities, respectively, it still needs an additional 17% of backhaul capacity for its high demand.
For statistical distribution of convergent iterations sampled from 300 simulations as shown in Fig. 3, we see that the PBCD has faster convergence than the JP-ADMM scheme. However, JP-ADMM surpasses PBCD in twofold: First, the size of the optimization problem in each iteration of PBCD is larger than

that of JP-ADMM. Second, PBCD is a centralized approach in which the controller needs all the tenantsâ€™ private information, whereas with distributed algorithm JP-ADMM, the controller only needs to observe the current physical resource load. Finally, in Fig 4, we study the trade-off between tenant load and backhaul cost in four-tenant scenario by tuning Ï‰. This table shows that lower values of Ï‰ give lower tenant load and higher backhaul cost, and vice versa.
V. CONCLUSIONS
We studied the network slicing for multiple services using RAN resources such as BS, cache storage, and backhaul capacity. The considered RAN network slicing is formulated as a bi-convex problem that accounts for dependencies between resource allocation for each slice and coordination of slices sharing the same resources. We proposed two algorithms for solving the formulated bi-convex problem and simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can converge to the solution validated by other baselines.
