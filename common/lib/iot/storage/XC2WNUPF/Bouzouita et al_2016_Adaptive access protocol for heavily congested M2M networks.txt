Abstract—Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications are expected to be one of the major drivers of future cellular networks, due to a plethora of services provided to operators and consumers. This leads to an explosively growth of simultaneous M2M arrivals, and then a bursty random access attempts that causes a severe random access congestion in addition to terminals’ synchronization issues. In this paper, we proposed a novel implementation of the Access Class Barring (ACB) scheme, that mainly consists of dynamically adapting the ACB factor according to the network’s overload conditions . Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing solutions by improving signiﬁcantly the access’s success probability while minimizing radio resources’ underutilization.
Keywords: MTC, M2M, Random Access, ACB, congestion collapse, dynamic ACB factor.
I. INTRODUCTION
Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications, with their capability of providing various types of applications and services [1], are already considered to be a crucial technology for 4G LTE-Advanced systems. They are also expected to become a key enabler for the ﬁfth generation (5G) networks being part of Internet of things (IoT) [2][3].
Indeed, M2M communications are expected to grow more and more during the forecast period between 2014 and 2019, reaching 10.5 billion connections by 2019 (up from 3.3 billion in 2014) [4]. Therefore, this numerous number of M2M devices may arrive simultaneously asking for network connection establishment [2].
To achieve that purpose, every device should ﬁrst perform the RACH (Random access channel) procedure [5] [6]. It initially selects one of the available preambles’ sequences. If the preamble is chosen by only that single device, the device can carry on with the RA (Random access) procedure. Otherwise, i.e. if two or more devices choose the same preamble sequence; a preamble collision is detected. Consequently, when the number of M2M devices becomes higher, this has a tremendous potential to generate a heavier random access trafﬁc and then results in a high preambles’ congestion. To tackle the problem of congestion at its root, 3GPP introduced the Access Class Barring (ACB) technique [7]. In fact, as a way to avoid useless M2M devices connections’ attempts, the ACB mechanism deﬁnes both a probability p, called the ACBfactor, and a time-duration, called the T barring [7]. Many contributions in the literature showed that generating

a dynamic value for the ACB factor according to the network overload is very efﬁcient [8][9][10]. However, this scheme presents many limits when dealing with baseline congestions. Indeed, in such conditions, it induces a synchronization of the terminals willing to connect, which results in poor performances.
To address this congestion issue, we propose, in this paper, a novel access protocol that adapts dynamically the access of M2M devices according to network’s congestion’s level.
The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 portrays our new adaptive access proposed protocol. Section 3 is dedicated to the simulation setup and the discussion of the obtained results. Finally, the paper concludes in Section 4 with a summary recapping the main advantages and achievements of the proposed access protocol.
II. DACB: DYNAMIC ACB FOR HEAVILY CONGESTED M2M NETWORKS
In this section, we will describe in details the proposed algorithm, named DACB, which is performed at each RACH opportunity.
In the envisioned scenario, a pool of x1 devices goes to a ﬁrst state x1 and starts the ACB check. Once the ACB check is successful, the M2M devices move to the state x2 to attempt the RA. x2 also depicted the total number of devices present at state x2. We will, in the following, denote xr2e,fmax as the number x2 maximizing the number of successful preambles’ transmissions (i.e. targeted load) [11] while xr2ef denotes a variable set point that is derived dynamically.
In the ﬁrst phase of the DACB algorithm, the eNodeB adjusts dynamically the set point xr2ef according to the overload situation. It uses the Exponential Weight Moving Average (EWMA) values Ave of x2 to check whether the overload level is high or not. If the congestion situation is heavy (line 6), the eNodeB decreases the xr2ef value, which enables to block more devices from attempting the random access in the subsequent step. Otherwise, i.e. in case of relaxed overload conditions (line 9), eNodeB increases the xr2ef in order to allow more devices to attempt the access in the following step. We consider only values within the interval [0; xr2e,fmax].
Once the dynamic targeted load determined, the eNodeB executes the phase 2 to generate the ACB factor at step n. If the average is less than xr2e,fmax at step n, the Pacb, in the next

step, is computed using equation in line 14. Otherwise, the
eNodeB applied a PID controller to make the total number of
M2M devices x2, contending for RA, converges to the optimal value xr2ef determined at step n. As Pacb is a probability, we apply: min (max (Pacb, 0) , 1) (line 18).
Both the dynamic adjustment of the set point and the ACB
factor generation are repeated in the following step (i.e. next
RACH opportunity).

B. Simulation results
To illustrate the effect of the DACB algorithm, we compare its performance against those obtained with a PID-based only method and a basic ACB method (ﬁxed p = 0.3), for distinct network loads. This comparison is made in terms of the following metrics: number of RA abandons, collision probability and ﬁnally idle probability of RA preambles.
Fig. 1 illustrates the evolution of the number of instantaneous and average values of RA attempts against the xr2e,fmax, when a DACB is applied. We can easily observe that even if the instant values oscillate between 40 and 70, the average ones remain very close to xr2e,fmax which is one of the objectives of dynamic ACB generation as it helps to maximize the success access probability and minimize the resources’ underutilization.

III. PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS
A. Simulation parameters
Having described in details our proposed algorithm, we direct now our focus to its performance using a discrete event simulator. Our simulator is developed under C and models the whole system described in section 2. During simulations, Poisson distribution is chosen for the MTC trafﬁc model where inter-arrivals are exponentially distributed. We also adopt a RACH conﬁguration where one RACH opportunity occurs every 10 ms with 54 preambles for each opportunity. The simulations’ parameters are summarized in Table I. When a RACH trial is declared unsuccessful, MTC device can retry the RA after a back off time chosen uniformly between 0 and the backoff parameter [5] ﬁxed in the following table.

Another way to test the performance improvements achieved by DACB can be reached by comparing the number of abandons for different network loads. Let’s see the results obtained in Fig. 2. We ﬁrst observe very little numbers of abandons (i.e. near to zero) and a greatly small ﬂuctuation of these numbers even if the number of M2M devices increases. Whereas, in case of only PID-based method the number of abandons increases when the networks become more heavily congested (i.e. from 60s). However, the number of abandons is intolerable from the beginning when applying an ordinary ACB scheme.
From Fig. 3, we ﬁrst note a very small ﬂuctuation of collision probabilities between different network loads in case of DACB scheme. In fact, this is due to the dynamic adjustment of the set point according to congestion level. Then, we can observe that collision probability is smaller when a PID scheme is applied and even in case of very congested networks (i.e. 28 × 104 M2M). This is due to the synchronization problem introduced in this paper. Another important observation is that the collision phenomenon becomes exacerbated when considering an ordinary ACB scheme.
On the other hand, we show the idle probability of preambles in Fig. 4. It can be easily seen that idle probability remains acceptable ( 40%), when a DACB is applied, even

if the network loads increases, which leads to a maximized resources’ utilization. However, idle probability is intolerable ( 100%) when applying the PID scheme. This is in complete conformance with the synchronization problems discussed above. We can also observe that idle probability decreases ( 0%) if an ordinary ACB scheme is considered. This is due to a large number of RA attempts and then the high collision probabilities obtained in Fig. 3.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we addressed the problem of heavy congested M2M networks, which exhibit a risk of synchronized access of M2M devices. A direct consequence of devices’ synchronization is either a signiﬁcant reduction of the number of successful RA and resources’ under-utilization, or a congestion collapse, even when using an efﬁcient ACB mechanism.
To cope with this problem, we have proposed a novel implementation of the ACB method, DACB, that consists in: (i) a dynamic adjustment of the model’s parameters depending on

RA congestion level, and (ii) calculating the ACB probability
according to the expected network’s overload situations.
The simulation results demonstrated the efﬁciency of the
DACB algorithm in terms of reduced congestion probability,
maximized success access probability and a minimized num-
ber of RA abandon, compared to existing approaches.
As a future work, we can direct our research to DACB
impact on the M2M device’s battery consumption.
