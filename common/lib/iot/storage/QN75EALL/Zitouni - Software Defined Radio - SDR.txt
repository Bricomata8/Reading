SDR Features
Features of SDR
Recongurability and reprogrammable of radio Tx/Rx Baseband waveform or radio functionality stored in memory
Different modulations, error correction coding Functional blocks can potentially be changed in real time Operating parameters of functional blocks can be adjusted by designer or automated programs.

Baseband refers to the original data signal (without up-converting with high frequency carrier), whereas passband refers to filtered signal that was originally modulated onto a carrier.

SDR Features
Multifunctionality: Same digital communication system platform which support multiple types of radio functions. e.g. Download software design of a radio.
Global Mobility: Standards are defined for particular geographical area. With an SDR, the transceivers operations are transparent. e.g. ISM frequency bands are different from Europe and US.
Compactness and Power Efficiency: One SDR platform supports many communication standards.
Ease of manufacturing: Migrate a baseband functions from hardware to software
Ease of Upgrading: Latest updates of standard specifications are considered by updating firmware software.

Software Communication Architecture (SCA)
Definition Open architecture framework that tells communications systems designers how elements of hardware and software are to operate in harmony. [Hay03] It enables communication platforms (e.g. software defined radios) to load applications (e.g. waveforms), run these applications, and be networked into an integrated system. It was created for JTRS
