examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics

Fixes a problem related to being allowed to write to USB ports as the /dev/ttyUSB0 used to flash the nodes
sudo usermod -a -G dialout user
For the change to take effect, you need to logout and log back in Not required if using the “IoT in five days” virtual image!

VERIFY THE RE-MOTE IS CONNECTED

examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics/01-hello-world.c

examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics/Makefile

To compile an application:
make TARGET=zoul 01-hello-world
The TARGET is used to tell the compiler which hardware platform it should compile for. For the Z1 platform is “z1”, for the RE-Mote (and others zoul-based platforms) is “zoul”
You can save the TARGET so next time you don’t have to type it:
make TARGET=zoul savetarget
This will create a Makefile.target file. If no TARGET argument is added in the compilation command line, the compiler will search a valid target in the Makefile.target file (if exists).

To compile and program an application to a RE-Mote:
make 01-hello-world.upload
The upload argument tells the compiler to invoke the programming scripts required to program the compiled binary to the device.
If no specific PORT argument is given, it will program all the REMotes connected over USB.
make 01-hello-world.upload PORT=/dev/ttyUSB0

Programming over the USB is posible as the “bootloader backdoor” is enabled as default in Contiki.
The CP2104 USB to serial converter creates the USB connection, when flashing the image to be programmed is transferred over USB from the Host to the on-board PIC-BSL microcontroller, which automatically puts the RE-Mote in “flashing mode” and transfers the image to the RE-Mote’s CC2538.
The script invoked by the compiler to program the RE-Mote is the cc2538-bsl, located in tools/cc2538-bsl. It is already included in Contiki.

MANUALLY ENTER THE FLASHING MODE
Press and hold user button, then press and hold reset button… release the reset button and then release the user button
https://youtu.be/6vg4f7U_kF4

To visualize the application output in a readable format, the following command is used:
make login
If no PORT is specified, it will open a connection to the first connected device it finds over USB.
make login PORT=/dev/ttyUSB0
Note you can execute one command after the other:
make 01-hello-world.upload PORT=/dev/ttyUSB0 && make login PORT=/dev/ttyUSB0

The next command is similar to make login, but it appends an UNIX timestamp:
make serialview
If no PORT is specified, it will open a connection to the first connected device it finds over USB.
make serialview PORT=/dev/ttyUSB0
You can also list the connected devices:
make motelist

Buttons and LEDs
Events and actions can be triggered by pressing the user button: send a message over the radio, take a sensor sample, start a process, etc.
The LEDs (light-emitting diodes) help us to understand what happens in the device, by using different colours and blinking sequences we know when an event is happening, if there are any errors or what happens in our application.

examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics/02-led-and-button.c

The application will wait (as it will be paused) until this event happens, saving processing cycles and energy
examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics/02-led-and-button.c

Press and hold the button, the LED will be on When the button is released, the LED will be off
examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics/02-led-and-button.c

platforms/zoul/remote/board.h

16 in binary is 00010000 Same as (1 << 4) The LED on should be the Green: #define LEDS_GREEN (1 << 4) /**< LED1 (Green) -> PD4 */
examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics/02-led-and-button.c

platforms/zoul/dev/button-sensor.h

Always after making a change to the source code, clean the previously compiled objects
make clean

What Color the LEDs will show? What number is printed when the LEDs are on? What will happen each time we press the button?
examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics/02-led-and-button.c

Each time we press the button, the LED will toggle on and off showing a yellow-ish color
examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics/02-led-and-button.c

We are waiting for ANY event to happen examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics/02-led-and-button.c

The press and hold option extends the possible alternatives the application would have to handle the user input
examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics/02-led-and-button.c

Timers
Timers allow to execute actions periodically, like measuring a sensor periodically, waiting a few seconds before executing a function, sending hourly reports, etc.

examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics/03-timers.c

The timer and stimer are computing-intensive, whereas the etimer, ctimer and rtimer generate events/callbacks only when the counter expires, saving processing cycles and energy
examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics/03-timers.c

CLOCK_SECOND is a constant defined by each platform, specifies the number of ticks a second has according to the platform’s clock. If you want to specify a 5 seconds timer, then use (CLOCK_SECOND * 5), or likewise half a second would be the nearest integer to (CLOCK_SECOND / 2)
examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics/03-timers.c

Each timer has its own API Aapplication Programming Interface) or commands, but mostly are alike:
core/sys/etimer.h

Depending on the type of timers we need to use, include a given header and create a timer structure
examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics/03-timers.c

RTIMER_NOW() is a macro returning the current tick count RTIMER_SECOND is a platform-defined constant, number of ticks/second
examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics/03-timers.c

examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics/03-timers.c

Print the value of CLOCK_SECOND and RTIMER_SECOND Turn on only the red LED each time the “tick” counter variable is even, and the blue LED whenever is odd. Use only the ctimer from the example Stop the timers whenever the user button is pressed Restart the timer and set the tick variable value to zero when the user button is pressed again
examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics/03-timers.c

examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics/03-timers.c

Processes
Contiki has two execution contexts: cooperative and preemptive Processes are cooperative and sequential, interrupts (button, sensors events) and the real-timer are preemptive.

https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki/wiki/Processes

examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics/04-processes.c

The process control block (RAM): contains runtime information about the process such as the name of the process, the state of the process, and a pointer to the process thread of the process.

The process thread (ROM): the code of the process

examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics/04-processes.c

Create two processes: One that increments a counter and toggles a LED. When the counter reaches ten (10), it should print a message to the screen. A second process that each time the user button is pressed, it will change the color of the LED to be toggled (i.e from Green to Blue, then Red, and repeat).
examples/zolertia/tutorial/01-basics/04-processes.c

Conclusions
You should be able to:
• Create and compile a basic Contiki application • Program a Zolertia device • Implements timers, LEDs and buttons in your application • Understand how Contiki processes and protothreads are
implemented • Create processes and tasks interacting with each other • Identify connected devices, visualize the debug output in the
screen
