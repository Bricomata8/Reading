ABSTRACT
Models for the processes by which ideas and inﬂuence propagate through a social network have been studied in a number of domains, including the diffusion of medical and technological innovations, the sudden and widespread adoption of various strategies in game-theoretic settings, and the effects of “word of mouth” in the promotion of new products. Recently, motivated by the design of viral marketing strategies, Domingos and Richardson posed a fundamental algorithmic problem for such social network processes: if we can try to convince a subset of individuals to adopt a new product or innovation, and the goal is to trigger a large cascade of further adoptions, which set of individuals should we target?
We consider this problem in several of the most widely studied models in social network analysis. The optimization problem of selecting the most inﬂuential nodes is NP-hard here, and we provide the ﬁrst provable approximation guarantees for efﬁcient algorithms. Using an analysis framework based on submodular functions, we show that a natural greedy strategy obtains a solution that is provably within 63% of optimal for several classes of models; our framework suggests a general approach for reasoning about the performance guarantees of algorithms for these types of inﬂuence problems in social networks.
We also provide computational experiments on large collaboration networks, showing that in addition to their provable guarantees, our approximation algorithms signiﬁcantly out-perform nodeselection heuristics based on the well-studied notions of degree centrality and distance centrality from the ﬁeld of social networks.

1. INTRODUCTION
A social network — the graph of relationships and interactions within a group of individuals — plays a fundamental role as a medium for the spread of information, ideas, and inﬂuence among its members. An idea or innovation will appear — for example, the use of cell phones among college students, the adoption of a new drug within the medical profession, or the rise of a political movement in an unstable society — and it can either die out quickly or make signiﬁcant inroads into the population. If we want to understand the extent to which such ideas are adopted, it can be important to understand how the dynamics of adoption are likely to unfold within the underlying social network: the extent to which people are likely to be affected by decisions of their friends and colleagues, or the extent to which “word-of-mouth” effects will take hold. Such network diffusion processes have a long history of study in the social sciences. Some of the earliest systematic investigations focused on data pertaining to the adoption of medical and agricultural innovations in both developed and developing parts of the world [8, 27, 29]; in other contexts, research has investigated diffusion processes for “word-of-mouth” and “viral marketing” effects in the success of new products [4, 7, 10, 13, 14, 20, 26], the sudden and widespread adoption of various strategies in gametheoretic settings [6, 12, 21, 32, 33], and the problem of cascading failures in power systems [2, 3].
In recent work, motivated by applications to marketing, Domingos and Richardson posed a fundamental algorithmic problem for such systems [10, 26]. Suppose that we have data on a social network, with estimates for the extent to which individuals inﬂuence one another, and we would like to market a new product that we hope will be adopted by a large fraction of the network. The premise of viral marketing is that by initially targeting a few “inﬂuential” members of the network — say, giving them free samples of the product — we can trigger a cascade of inﬂuence by which friends will recommend the product to other friends, and many individuals will ultimately try it. But how should we choose the few key individuals to use for seeding this process? In [10, 26], this question was considered in a probabilistic model of interaction; heuristics were given for choosing customers with a large overall effect on the network, and methods were also developed to infer the inﬂuence data necessary for posing these types of problems.
In this paper, we consider the issue of choosing inﬂuential sets of individuals as a problem in discrete optimization. The optimal solution is NP-hard for most models that have been studied, including the model of [10]. The framework proposed in [26], on the other

hand, is based on a simple linear model where the solution to the optimization problem can be obtained by solving a system of linear equations. Here we focus on a collection of related, NP-hard models that have been extensively studied in the social networks community, and obtain the ﬁrst provable approximation guarantees for efﬁcient algorithms in a number of general cases. The generality of the models we consider lies between that of the polynomial-time solvable model of [26] and the very general model of [10], where the optimization problem cannot even be approximated to within a non-trivial factor.
We begin by departing somewhat from the Domingos-Richardson framework in the following sense: where their models are essentially descriptive, specifying a joint distribution over all nodes’ behavior in a global sense, we focus on more operational models from mathematical sociology [15, 28] and interacting particle systems [11, 17] that explicitly represent the step-by-step dynamics of adoption. We show that approximation algorithms for maximizing the spread of inﬂuence in these models can be developed in a general framework based on submodular functions [9, 23]. We also provide computational experiments on large collaboration networks, showing that in addition to their provable guarantees, our algorithms signiﬁcantly out-perform node-selection heuristics based on the well-studied notions of degree centrality and distance centrality [30] from the ﬁeld of social network analysis.
Two Basic Diffusion Models. In considering operational models
for the spread of an idea or innovation through a social network G, represented by a directed graph, we will speak of each individual node as being either active (an adopter of the innovation) or inactive. We will focus on settings, guided by the motivation discussed above, in which each node’s tendency to become active increases monotonically as more of its neighbors become active. Also, we will focus for now on the progressive case in which nodes can switch from being inactive to being active, but do not switch in the other direction; it turns out that this assumption can easily be lifted later. Thus, the process will look roughly as follows from the perspective of an initially inactive node v: as time unfolds, more and more of v’s neighbors become active; at some point, this may cause v to become active, and v’s decision may in turn trigger further decisions by nodes to which v is connected.
Granovetter and Schelling were among the ﬁrst to propose models that capture such a process; their approach was based on the use of node-speciﬁc thresholds [15, 28]. Many models of this ﬂavor have since been investigated (see e.g. [5, 15, 18, 19, 21, 25, 28, 29, 31, 32, 33])but the following Linear Threshold Model lies at the core of most subsequent generalizations. In this model, a node v is inﬂuenced by each neighbor w according to a weight bv,w such that
bv,w ≤ 1. The dynamics of the process then proceed
w neighbor of v
as follows. Each node v chooses a threshold θv uniformly at random from the interval [0, 1]; this represents the weighted fraction of v’s neighbors that must become active in order for v to become active. Given a random choice of thresholds, and an initial set of active nodes A0 (with all other nodes inactive), the diffusion process unfolds deterministically in discrete steps: in step t, all nodes that were active in step t − 1 remain active, and we activate any node v for which the total weight of its active neighbors is at least θv :
bv,w ≥ θv.
w active neighbor of v
Thus, the thresholds θv intuitively represent the different latent tendencies of nodes to adopt the innovation when their neighbors do;

the fact that these are randomly selected is intended to model our lack of knowledge of their values — we are in effect averaging over possible threshold values for all the nodes. (Another class of approaches hard-wires all thresholds at a known value like 1/2; see for example work by Berger [5], Morris [21], and Peleg [25].)
Based on work in interacting particle systems [11, 17] from probability theory, we can also consider dynamic cascade models for diffusion processes. The conceptually simplest model of this type is what one could call the Independent Cascade Model, investigated recently in the context of marketing by Goldenberg, Libai, and Muller [13, 14]. We again start with an initial set of active nodes A0, and the process unfolds in discrete steps according to the following randomized rule. When node v ﬁrst becomes active in step t, it is given a single chance to activate each currently inactive neighbor w; it succeeds with a probability pv,w — a parameter of the system — independently of the history thus far. (If w has multiple newly activated neighbors, their attempts are sequenced in an arbitrary order.) If v succeeds, then w will become active in step t + 1; but whether or not v succeeds, it cannot make any further attempts to activate w in subsequent rounds. Again, the process runs until no more activations are possible.
The Linear Threshold and Independent Cascade Models are two of the most basic and widely-studied diffusion models, but of course many extensions can be considered. We will turn to this issue later in the paper, proposing a general framework that simultaneously includes both of these models as special cases. For the sake of concreteness in the introduction, we will discuss our results in terms of these two models in particular.
Approximation Algorithms for Inﬂuence Maximization. We are
now in a position to formally express the Domingos-Richardson style of optimization problem — choosing a good initial set of nodes to target — in the context of the above models. Both the Linear Threshold and Independent Cascade Models (as well as the generalizations to follow) involve an initial set of active nodes A0 that start the diffusion process. We deﬁne the inﬂuence of a set of nodes A, denoted σ(A), to be the expected number of active nodes at the end of the process, given that A is this initial active set A0. The inﬂuence maximization problem asks, for a parameter k, to ﬁnd a k-node set of maximum inﬂuence. (When dealing with algorithms for this problem, we will say that the chosen set A of k initial active nodes has been targeted for activation by the algorithm.) For the models we consider, it is NP-hard to determine the optimum for inﬂuence maximization, as we will show later.
Our ﬁrst main result is that the optimal solution for inﬂuence maximization can be efﬁciently approximated to within a factor of (1 − 1/e − ε), in both the Linear Threshold and Independent Cascade models; here e is the base of the natural logarithm and ε is any positive real number. (Thus, this is a performance guarantee slightly better than 63%.) The algorithm that achieves this performance guarantee is a natural greedy hill-climbing strategy related to the approach considered in [10], and so the main content of this result is the analysis framework needed for obtaining a provable performance guarantee, and the fairly surprising fact that hill-climbing is always within a factor of at least 63% of optimal for this problem. We prove this result in Section 2 using techniques from the theory of submodular functions [9, 23], which we describe in detail below, and which turn out to provide a natural context for reasoning about both models and algorithms for inﬂuence maximization.
In fact, this analysis framework allows us to design and prove guarantees for approximation algorithms in much richer and more realistic models of the processes by which we market to nodes. The

deterministic activation of individual nodes is a highly simpliﬁed model; an issue also considered in [10, 26] is that we may in reality have a large number of different marketing actions available, each of which may inﬂuence nodes in different ways. The available budget can be divided arbitrarily between these actions. We show how to extend the analysis to this substantially more general framework. Our main result here is that a generalization of the hill-climbing algorithm still provides approximation guarantees arbitrarily close to (1 − 1/e).
It is worth brieﬂy considering the general issue of performance guarantees for algorithms in these settings. For both the Linear Threshold and the Independent Cascade models, the inﬂuence maximization problem is NP-complete, but it can be approximated well. In the linear model of Richardson and Domingos [26], on the other hand, both the propagation of inﬂuence as well as the effect of the initial targeting are linear. Initial marketing decisions here are thus limited in their effect on node activations; each node’s probability of activation is obtained as a linear combination of the effect of targeting and the effect of the neighbors. In this fully linear model, the inﬂuence can be maximized by solving a system of linear equations. In contrast, we can show that general models like that of Domingos and Richardson [10], and even simple models that build in a ﬁxed threshold (like 1/2) at all nodes [5, 21, 25], lead to inﬂuence maximization problems that cannot be approximated to within any non-trivial factor, assuming P = NP. Our analysis of approximability thus suggests a way of tracing out a more delicate boundary of tractability through the set of possible models, by helping to distinguish among those for which simple heuristics provide strong performance guarantees and those for which they can be arbitrarily far from optimal. This in turn can suggest the development of both more powerful algorithms, and the design of accurate models that simultaneously allow for tractable optimization.
Following the approximation and NP-hardness results, we describe in Section 3 the results of computational experiments with both the Linear Threshold and Independent Cascade Models, showing that the hill-climbing algorithm signiﬁcantly out-performs strategies based on targeting high-degree or “central” nodes [30]. In Section 4 we then develop a general model of diffusion processes in social networks that simultaneously generalizes the Linear Threshold and Independent Cascade Models, as well as a number of other natural cases, and we show how to obtain approximation guarantees for a large sub-class of these models. In Sections 5 and 6, we also consider extensions of our approximation algorithms to models with more realistic scenarios in mind: more complex marketing actions as discussed above, and non-progressive processes, in which active nodes may become inactive in subsequent steps.
2. APPROXIMATION GUARANTEES IN THE INDEPENDENT CASCADE AND LINEAR THRESHOLD MODELS
The overall approach. We begin by describing our strategy for
proving approximation guarantees. Consider an arbitrary function f (·) that maps subsets of a ﬁnite ground set U to non-negative real numbers.1 We say that f is submodular if it satisﬁes a natural “diminishing returns” property: the marginal gain from adding an element to a set S is at least as high as the marginal gain from adding
1Note that the inﬂuence function σ(·) deﬁned above has this form; it maps each subset A of the nodes of the social network to a real number denoting the expected size of the activated set if A is targeted for initial activation.

the same element to a superset of S. Formally, a submodular function satisﬁes
f (S ∪ {v}) − f (S) ≥ f (T ∪ {v}) − f (T ),
for all elements v and all pairs of sets S ⊆ T . Submodular functions have a number of very nice tractability
properties; the one that is relevant to us here is the following. Suppose we have a function f that is submodular, takes only nonnegative values, and is monotone in the sense that adding an element to a set cannot cause f to decrease: f (S ∪ {v}) ≥ f (S) for all elements v and sets S. We wish to ﬁnd a k-element set S for which f (S) is maximized. This is an NP-hard optimization problem (it can be shown to contain the Hitting Set problem as a simple special case), but a result of Nemhauser, Wolsey, and Fisher [9, 23] shows that the following greedy hill-climbing algorithm approximates the optimum to within a factor of (1 − 1/e) (where e is the base of the natural logarithm): start with the empty set, and repeatedly add an element that gives the maximum marginal gain.
THEOREM 2.1. [9, 23] For a non-negative, monotone submodular function f , let S be a set of size k obtained by selecting elements one at a time, each time choosing an element that provides the largest marginal increase in the function value. Let S∗ be a set that maximizes the value of f over all k-element sets. Then f (S) ≥ (1 − 1/e) · f (S∗); in other words, S provides a (1 − 1/e)approximation.
Due to its generality, this result has found applications in a number of areas of discrete optimization (see e.g. [22]); the only direct use of it that we are aware of in the databases and data mining literature is in a context very different from ours, for the problem of selecting database views to materialize [16].
Our strategy will be to show that for the models we are considering, the resulting inﬂuence function σ(·) is submodular. A subtle difﬁculty lies in the fact that the result of Nemhauser et al. assumes that the greedy algorithm can evaluate the underlying function exactly, which may not be the case for the inﬂuence function σ(A). However, by simulating the diffusion process and sampling the resulting active sets, we are able to obtain arbitrarily close approximations to σ(A), with high probability. Furthermore, one can extend the result of Nemhauser et al. to show that for any ε > 0, there is a γ > 0 such that by using (1 + γ)-approximate values for the function to be optimized, we obtain a (1 − 1/e − ε)-approximation.
As mentioned in the introduction, we can extend this analysis to a general model with more complex marketing actions that can have a probabilistic effect on the initial activation of nodes. We show in Section 6 how, with a more careful hill-climbing algorithm and a generalization of Theorem 2.1, we can obtain comparable approximation guarantees in this setting.
A further extension is to assume that each node v has an associated non-negative weight wv, capturing how important it is that v be activated in the ﬁnal outcome. (For instance, if we are marketing textbooks to college teachers, then the weight could be the number of students in the teacher’s class, resulting in a larger or smaller number of sales.) If we let B denote the (random) set activated by the process with initial activation A, then we can deﬁne the weighted inﬂuence function σw(A) to be the expected value over outcomes B of the quantity v∈B wv. The inﬂuence function studied above is the special case obtained by setting wv = 1 for all nodes v. The objective function with weights is submodular whenever the unweighted version is, so we can still use the greedy algorithm for obtaining a (1 − 1/e − ε)-approximation. Note, however, that a sampling algorithm to approximately choose the next element may need time that depends on the sizes of the weights.

Independent Cascade
In view of the above discussion, an approximation guarantee for inﬂuence maximization in the Independent Cascade Model will be a consequence of the following
THEOREM 2.2. For an arbitrary instance of the Independent Cascade Model, the resulting inﬂuence function σ(·) is submodular.
In order to establish this result, we need to look, implicitly or explicitly, at the expression σ(A ∪ {v}) − σ(A), for arbitrary sets A and elements v. In other words, what increase do we get in the expected number of overall activations when we add v to the set A? This increase is very difﬁcult to analyze directly, because it is hard to work with quantities of the form σ(A). For example, the Independent Cascade process is underspeciﬁed, since we have not prescribed the order in which newly activated nodes in a given step t will attempt to activate their neighbors. Thus, it is not initially obvious that the process is even well-deﬁned, in the sense that it yields the same distribution over outcomes regardless of how we schedule the attempted activations.
Our proof deals with these difﬁculties by formulating an equivalent view of the process, which makes it easier to see that there is an order-independent outcome, and which provides an alternate way to reason about the submodularity property.
Consider a point in the cascade process when node v has just become active, and it attempts to activate its neighbor w, succeeding with probability pv,w. We can view the outcome of this random event as being determined by ﬂipping a coin of bias pv,w. From the point of view of the process, it clearly does not matter whether the coin was ﬂipped at the moment that v became active, or whether it was ﬂipped at the very beginning of the whole process and is only being revealed now. Continuing this reasoning, we can in fact assume that for each pair of neighbors (v, w) in the graph, a coin of bias pv,w is ﬂipped at the very beginning of the process (independently of the coins for all other pairs of neighbors), and the result is stored so that it can be later checked in the event that v is activated while w is still inactive.
With all the coins ﬂipped in advance, the process can be viewed as follows. The edges in G for which the coin ﬂip indicated an activation will be successful are declared to be live; the remaining edges are declared to be blocked. If we ﬁx the outcomes of the coin ﬂips and then initially activate a set A, it is clear how to determine the full set of active nodes at the end of the cascade process:
CLAIM 2.3. A node x ends up active if and only if there is a path from some node in A to x consisting entirely of live edges. (We will call such a path a live-edge path.)
Consider the probability space in which each sample point speciﬁes one possible set of outcomes for all the coin ﬂips on the edges. Let X denote one sample point in this space, and deﬁne σX (A) to be the total number of nodes activated by the process when A is the set initially targeted, and X is the set of outcomes of all coin ﬂips on edges. Because we have ﬁxed a choice for X, σX (A) is in fact a deterministic quantity, and there is a natural way to express its value, as follows. Let R(v, X) denote the set of all nodes that can be reached from v on a path consisting entirely of live edges. By Claim 2.3, σX(A) is the number of nodes that can be reached on live-edge paths from any node in A, and so it is equal to the cardinality of the union ∪v∈AR(v, X).
Proof of Theorem 2.2. First, we claim that for each ﬁxed outcome X, the function σX (·) is submodular. To see this, let S and

T be two sets of nodes such that S ⊆ T , and consider the quantity σX (S ∪ {v})−σX(S). This is the number of elements in R(v, X) that are not already in the union ∪u∈SR(u, X); it is at least as large as the number of elements in R(v, X) that are not in the (bigger) union ∪u∈T R(u, X). It follows that σX (S ∪ {v}) − σX (S) ≥ σX (T ∪ {v}) − σX (T ), which is the deﬁning inequality for sub-
modularity. Finally, we have

σ(A) =

Prob[X] · σX (A),

outcomes X

since the expected number of nodes activated is just the weighted average over all outcomes. But a non-negative linear combination of submodular functions is also submodular, and hence σ(·) is submodular, which concludes the proof.

Next we show the hardness of inﬂuence maximization.
THEOREM 2.4. The inﬂuence maximization problem is NP-hard for the Independent Cascade model.

Proof. Consider an instance of the NP-complete Set Cover problem, deﬁned by a collection of subsets S1, S2, . . . , Sm of a ground set U = {u1, u2, . . . , un}; we wish to know whether there exist k of the subsets whose union is equal to U . (We can assume that k < n < m.) We show that this can be viewed as a special case of the inﬂuence maximization problem.
Given an arbitrary instance of the Set Cover problem, we deﬁne a corresponding directed bipartite graph with n + m nodes: there is a node i corresponding to each set Si, a node j corresponding to each element uj, and a directed edge (i, j) with activation probability pi,j = 1 whenever uj ∈ Si. The Set Cover problem is equivalent to deciding if there is a set A of k nodes in this graph with σ(A) ≥ n + k. Note that for the instance we have deﬁned, activation is a deterministic process, as all probabilities are 0 or 1. Initially activating the k nodes corresponding to sets in a Set Cover solution results in activating all n nodes corresponding to the ground set U , and if any set A of k nodes has σ(A) ≥ n + k, then the Set Cover problem must be solvable.
Linear Thresholds
We now prove an analogous result for the Linear Threshold Model.

THEOREM 2.5. For an arbitrary instance of the Linear Threshold Model, the resulting inﬂuence function σ(·) is submodular.

Proof. The analysis is a bit more intricate than in the proof of The-
orem 2.2, but the overall argument has a similar structure. In the proof of Theorem 2.2, we constructed an equivalent process by initially resolving the outcomes of some random choices, considering each outcome in isolation, and then averaging over all outcomes. For the Linear Threshold Model, the simplest analogue would be to
consider the behavior of the process after all node thresholds have been chosen. Unfortunately, for a ﬁxed choice of thresholds, the number of activated nodes is not in general a submodular function of the targeted set; this fact necessitates a more subtle analysis.
Recall that each node v has an inﬂuence weight bv,w ≥ 0 from each of its neighbors w, subject to the constraint that w bv,w ≤ 1. (We can extend the notation by writing bv,w = 0 when w is not a neighbor of v.) Suppose that v picks at most one of its incoming edges at random, selecting the edge from w with probability bv,w and selecting no edge with probability 1 − w bv,w. The selected edge is declared to be “live,” and all other edges are declared to be “blocked.” (Note the contrast with the proof of Theorem 2.2:
there, we determined whether an edge was live independently of

the decision for each other edge; here, we negatively correlate the decisions so that at most one live edge enters each node.)
The crux of the proof lies in establishing Claim 2.6 below, which asserts that the Linear Threshold model is equivalent to reachability via live-edge paths as deﬁned above. Once that equivalence is established, submodularity follows exactly as in the proof of Theorem 2.2. We can deﬁne R(v, X) as before to be the set of all nodes reachable from v on live-edge paths, subject to a choice X of live/blocked designations for all edges; it follows that σX(A) is the cardinality of the union ∪v∈AR(v, X), and hence a submodular function of A; ﬁnally, the function σ(·) is a non-negative linear combination of the functions σX (·) and hence also submodular.
CLAIM 2.6. For a given targeted set A, the following two distributions over sets of nodes are the same:
(i) The distribution over active sets obtained by running the Linear Threshold process to completion starting from A; and
(ii) The distribution over sets reachable from A via live-edge paths, under the random selection of live edges deﬁned above.

Proof. We need to prove that reachability under our random choice

of live and blocked edges deﬁnes a process equivalent to that of

the Linear Threshold Model. To obtain intuition about this equiv-

alence, it is useful to ﬁrst analyze the special case in which the

underlying graph G is directed and acyclic. In this case, we can ﬁx

a topological ordering of the nodes v1, v2, . . . , vn (so that all edges

go from earlier nodes to later nodes in the order), and build up the

distribution of active sets by following this order. For each node vi,

suppose we already have determined the distribution over active

subsets of its neighbors. Then under the Linear Threshold process,

the probability that vi will become active, given that a subset Si

of its neighbors is active, is w∈Si bvi,w. This is probability that the live incoming edge selected by

precisely vi lies in

the Si,

and so inductively we see that the two processes deﬁne the same

distribution over active sets.

To prove the claim generally, consider a graph G that is not

acyclic. It becomes trickier to show the equivalence, because there

is no natural ordering of the nodes over which to perform induc-

tion. Instead, we argue by induction over the iterations of the Lin-

ear Threshold process. We deﬁne At to be the set of active nodes at the end of iteration t, for t = 0, 1, 2, . . . (note that A0 is the set initially targeted). If node v has not become active by the end of

iteration t, then the probability that it becomes active in iteration

t + 1 is equal to the chance that the inﬂuence weights in At \ At−1

push it over its threshold, given that its threshold was not exceeded

already;

this

probability

is

1

u∈At \At−1
− u∈At−1

bv,u bv,u

.

On the other hand, we can run the live-edge process by revealing

the identities of the live edges gradually as follows. We start with

the targeted set A. For each node v with at least one edge from the

set A, we determine whether v’s live edge comes from A. If so,

then v is reachable; but if not, we keep the source of v’s live edge

unknown, subject to the condition that it comes from outside A.

Having now exposed a new set of reachable nodes A1 in the ﬁrst stage, we proceed to identify further reachable nodes by perform-

ing the same process on edges from A1, and in this way produce sets A2, A3, . . .. If node v has not been determined to be reachable by the end of stage t, then the probability that it is determined to

be reachable in stage t + 1 is equal to the chance that its live edge

comes from At \ At−1, given that its live edge has not come from

any

of

the

earlier

sets.

But

this

is

1

b u∈At\At−1 v,u − b u∈At−1 v,u

,

which

is

the

same as in the Linear Threshold process of the previous paragraph. Thus, by induction over these stages, we see that the live-edge process produces the same distribution over active sets as the Linear Threshold process.
Inﬂuence maximization is hard in this model as well.
THEOREM 2.7. The inﬂuence maximization problem is NP-hard for the Linear Threshold model.
Proof. Consider an instance of the NP-complete Vertex Cover problem deﬁned by an undirected n-node graph G = (V, E) and an integer k; we want to know if there is a set S of k nodes in G so that every edge has at least one endpoint in S. We show that this can be viewed as a special case of the inﬂuence maximization problem.
Given an instance of the Vertex Cover problem involving a graph G, we deﬁne a corresponding instance of the inﬂuence maximization problem by directing all edges of G in both directions. If there is a vertex cover S of size k in G, then one can deterministically make σ(A) = n by targeting the nodes in the set A = S; conversely, this is the only way to get a set A with σ(A) = n.
In the proofs of both the approximation theorems in this section, we established submodularity by considering an equivalent process in which each node “hard-wired” certain of its incident edges as transmitting inﬂuence from neighbors. This turns out to be a proof technique that can be formulated in general terms, and directly applied to give approximability results for other models as well. We discuss this further in the context of the general framework presented in Section 4.
3. EXPERIMENTS
In addition to obtaining worst-case guarantees on the performance of our approximation algorithm, we are interested in understanding its behavior in practice, and comparing its performance to other heuristics for identifying inﬂuential individuals. We ﬁnd that our greedy algorithm achieves signiﬁcant performance gains over several widely-used structural measures of inﬂuence in social networks [30].
The Network Data. For evaluation, it is desirable to use a network
dataset that exhibits many of the structural features of large-scale social networks. At the same time, we do not address the issue of inferring actual inﬂuence parameters from network observations (see e.g. [10, 26]). Thus, for our testbed, we employ a collaboration graph obtained from co-authorships in physics publications, with simple settings of the inﬂuence parameters. It has been argued extensively that co-authorship networks capture many of the key features of social networks more generally [24]. The co-authorship data was compiled from the complete list of papers in the highenergy physics theory section of the e-print arXiv (www.arxiv.org).2
The collaboration graph contains a node for each researcher who has at least one paper with co-author(s) in the arXiv database. For each paper with two or more authors, we inserted an edge for each pair of authors (single-author papers were ignored). Notice that this results in parallel edges when two researchers have co-authored multiple papers — we kept these parallel edges as they can be interpreted to indicate stronger social ties between the researchers involved. The resulting graph has 10748 nodes, and edges between about 53000 pairs of nodes.
2We also ran experiments on the co-authorship graphs induced by theoretical computer science papers. We do not report on the results here, as they are very similar to the ones for high-energy physics.

While processing the data, we corrected many common types of mistakes automatically or manually. In order to deal with aliasing problems at least partially, we abbreviated ﬁrst names, and uniﬁed spellings for foreign characters. We believe that the resulting graph is a good approximation to the actual collaboration graph (the sheer volume of data prohibits a complete manual cleaning pass).

The Inﬂuence Models. We compared the algorithms in three dif-

ferent models of inﬂuence. In the linear threshold model, we treated

the multiplicity of edges as weights. If nodes u, v have cu,v parallel

edges between them, and degrees du and dv, then the edge (u, v)

has

weight

cu,v dv

,

and

the

edge

(v, u)

has

weight

. cu,v
du

In the independent cascade model, we assigned a uniform proba-

bility of p to each edge of the graph, choosing p to be 1% and 10%

in separate trials. If nodes u and v have cu,v parallel edges, then we assume that for each of those cu,v edges, u has a chance of p to activate v, i.e. u has a total probability of 1 − (1 − p)cu,v of

activating v once it becomes active.

The independent cascade model with uniform probabilities p on

the edges has the property that high-degree nodes not only have

a chance to inﬂuence many other nodes, but also to be inﬂuenced

by them. Whether or not this is a desirable interpretation of the

inﬂuence data is an application-speciﬁc issue. Motivated by this,

we chose to also consider an alternative interpretation, where edges

into high-degree nodes are assigned smaller probabilities. We study

a special case of the Independent Cascade Model that we term

“weighted cascade”, in which each edge from node u to v is as-

signed probability 1/dv of activating v. The weighted cascade

model resembles the linear threshold model in that the expected

number of neighbors who would succeed in activating a node v is

1 in both models.

The algorithms and implementation. We compare our greedy
algorithm with heuristics based on nodes’ degrees and centrality within the network, as well as the crude baseline of choosing random nodes to target. The degree and centrality-based heuristics are commonly used in the sociology literature as estimates of a node’s inﬂuence [30].
The high-degree heuristic chooses nodes v in order of decreasing degrees dv. Considering high-degree nodes as inﬂuential has long been a standard approach for social and other networks [30, 1], and is known in the sociology literature as “degree centrality”.
“Distance centrality” is another commonly used inﬂuence measure in sociology, building on the assumption that a node with short paths to other nodes in a network will have a higher chance of inﬂuencing them. Hence, we select nodes in order of increasing average distance to other nodes in the network. As the arXiv collaboration graph is not connected, we assigned a distance of n — the number of nodes in the graph — for any pair of unconnected nodes. This value is signiﬁcantly larger than any actual distance, and thus can be considered to play the role of an inﬁnite distance. In particular, nodes in the largest connected component will have smallest average distance.
Finally, we consider, as a baseline, the result of choosing nodes uniformly at random. Notice that because the optimization problem is NP-hard, and the collaboration graph is prohibitively large, we cannot compute the optimum value to verify the actual quality of approximations.
Both in choosing the nodes to target with the greedy algorithm, and in evaluating the performance of the algorithms, we need to compute the value σ(A). It is an open question to compute this quantity exactly by an efﬁcient method, but very good estimates can be obtained by simulating the random process. More specif-

ically, we simulate the process 10000 times for each targeted set, re-choosing thresholds or edge outcomes pseudo-randomly from [0, 1] every time. Previous runs indicate that the quality of approximation after 10000 iterations is comparable to that after 300000 or more iterations.
The results. Figure 1 shows the performance of the algorithms
in the linear threshold model. The greedy algorithm outperforms the high-degree node heuristic by about 18%, and the central node heuristic by over 40%. (As expected, choosing random nodes is not a good idea.) This shows that signiﬁcantly better marketing results can be obtained by explicitly considering the dynamics of information in a network, rather than relying solely on structural properties of the graph.

Figure 1: Results for the linear threshold model

When investigating the reason why the high-degree and centrality heuristics do not perform as well, one sees that they ignore such network effects. In particular, neither of the heuristics incorporates the fact that many of the most central (or highest-degree) nodes may be clustered, so that targeting all of them is unnecessary. In fact, the uneven nature of these curves suggests that the network inﬂuence of many nodes is not accurately reﬂected by their degree or centrality.
Figure 2 shows the results for the weighted cascade model. Notice the striking similarity to the linear threshold model. The scale is slightly different (all values are about 25% smaller), but the behavior is qualitatively the same, even with respect to the exact nodes whose network inﬂuence is not reﬂected accurately by their degree or centrality. The reason is that in expectation, each node is inﬂuenced by the same number of other nodes in both models (see Section 2), and the degrees are relatively concentrated around their expectation of 1.
The graph for the independent cascade model with probability 1%, given in Figure 3, seems very similar to the previous two at ﬁrst glance. Notice, however, the very different scale: on average, each targeted node only activates three additional nodes. Hence, the network effects in the independent cascade model with very small probabilities are much weaker than in the other models. Several nodes have degrees well exceeding 100, so the probabilities on their incoming edges are even smaller than 1% in the weighted cascade model. This suggests that the network effects observed for the linear threshold and weighted cascade models rely heavily on low-degree nodes as multipliers, even though targeting high-degree

The improvement in performance of the “random nodes” heuristic is even more pronounced for the independent cascade model with probabilities equal to 10%, depicted in Figure 4. In that model, it starts to outperform both the high-degree and the central nodes heuristics when more than 12 nodes are targeted. It is initially surprising that random targeting for this model should lead to more activations than centrality-based targeting, but in fact there is a natural underlying reason that we explore now.
The ﬁrst targeted node, if chosen somewhat judiciously, will activate a large fraction of the network, in our case almost 25%. However, any additional nodes will only reach a small additional fraction of the network. In particular, other central or high-degree nodes are very likely to be activated by the initially chosen one, and thus have hardly any marginal gain. This explains the shapes of the curves for the high-degree and centrality heuristics, which leap up to about 2415 activated nodes, but make virtually no progress afterwards. The greedy algorithm, on the other hand, takes the effect of the ﬁrst chosen node into account, and targets nodes with smaller

marginal gain afterwards. Hence, its active set keeps growing, although at a much smaller slope than in other models.
The random heuristic does not do as well initially as the other heuristics, but with sufﬁciently many attempts, it eventually hits some highly inﬂuential nodes and becomes competitive with the centrality-based node choices. Because it does not focus exclusively on central nodes, it eventually targets nodes with additional marginal gain, and surpasses the two centrality-based heuristics.
4. A GENERAL FRAMEWORK FOR INFLUENCE MAXIMIZATION

General Threshold and Cascade Models. We have thus far been
considering two speciﬁc, widely studied models for the diffusion of inﬂuence. We now propose a broader framework that simultaneously generalizes these two models, and allows us to explore the limits of models in which strong approximation guarantees can be obtained. Our general framework has equivalent formulations in terms of thresholds and cascades, thereby unifying these two views of diffusion through a social network.

• A general threshold model. We would like to be able to

express the notion that a node v’s decision to become ac-

tive can be based on an arbitrary monotone function of the

set of neighbors of v that are already active. Thus, associ-

ated with v is a monotone threshold function fv that maps subsets of v’s neighbor set to real numbers in [0, 1], sub-

ject to the condition that fv(∅) = 0. The diffusion pro-

cess follows the general structure of the Linear Threshold

Model. Each node v initially chooses θv uniformly at random from the interval [0, 1]. Now, however, v becomes active

in step t if fv(S) ≥ θv, where S is the set of neighbors of v that are active in step t − 1. Note that the Linear Threshold

Model is the special case in which each threshold function

has the form fv(S) = u∈S bv,u for parameters bv,u such

that

bv,u ≤ 1.

u neighbor of v
• A general cascade model. We generalize the cascade model to allow the probability that u succeeds in activating a neighbor v to depend on the set of v’s neighbors that have already tried. Thus, we deﬁne an incremental function pv(u, S) ∈ [0, 1], where S and {u} are disjoint subsets of v’s neighbor

set. A general cascade process works by analogy with the independent case: in the general case, when u attempts to activate v, it succeeds with probability pv(u, S), where S is the set of neighbors that have already tried (and failed) to activate v. The Independent Cascade Model is the special case where pv(u, S) is a constant pu,v, independent of S. We will only be interested in cascade models deﬁned by incremental
functions that are order-independent in the following sense: if neighbors u1, u2, . . . , u try to activate v, then the probability that v is activated at the end of these attempts does not depend on the order in which the attempts are made.

These two models are equivalent, and we give a method to con-
vert between them. First, consider an instance of the general threshold model with threshold functions fv. To deﬁne an equivalent cascade model, we need to understand the probability that an additional neighbor u can activate v, given that the nodes in a set S have already tried and failed. If the nodes in S have failed, then node v’s threshold θv must be in the range θv ∈ (fv(S), 1]. However, subject to this constraint, it is uniformly distributed.Thus, the probability that a neighbor u ∈/ S succeeds in activating v, given that the nodes in S have failed, is

pv(u, S)

=

fv (S

∪ 1

{u}) − fv − fv(S)

(S

)

.

It is not difﬁcult to show that the cascade process with these func-

tions is equivalent to the original threshold process.

Conversely, consider a node v in the cascade model, and a set

S = {u1, . . . , uk} of its neighbors. Assume that the nodes in S try

to activate v in the order u1, . . . , uk, and let Si = {u1, . . . , ui}.

Then the probability that v is not activated by this process is by def-

inition ki=1(1 − pv(ui, Si−1)). Recall that we assumed that the order in which the ui try to activate v does not affect their overall

success probability. Hence, this value depends on the set S only,

and we can deﬁne fv(S) = 1 −

k i=1

(1

−

pv(ui, Si−1)).

Anal-

ogously, one can show that this instance of the threshold model is

equivalent to the original cascade process.

An Inapproximability Result. The general model proposed above
includes large families of instances for which the inﬂuence function σ(·) is not submodular. Indeed, it may become NP-hard to approximate the optimization problem to within any non-trivial factor.

THEOREM 4.1. In general, it is NP-hard to approximate the inﬂuence maximization problem to within a factor of n1−ε, for any
ε > 0.

Proof. To prove this result, we reduce from the Set Cover prob-
lem. We start with the construction from the proof of Theorem 2.4, letting u1, . . . , un denote the nodes corresponding to the n elements; i.e. ui becomes active when at least one of the nodes corresponding to sets containing ui is active. Next, for an arbitrarily large constant c, we add N = nc more nodes x1, . . . , xN ; each xj is connected to all of the nodes ui, and it becomes active only when all of the ui are.
If there are at most k sets that cover all elements, then activating the nodes corresponding to these k sets will activate all of the nodes ui, and thus also all of the xj. In total, at least N + n + k nodes will be active. Conversely, if there is no set cover of size k, then no targeted set will activate all of the ui, and hence none of the xj will become active (unless targeted). In particular, fewer than n+k
nodes are active in the end. If an algorithm could approximate the problem within n1−ε for any ε, it could distinguish between the cases where N + n + k nodes are active in the end, and where

fewer than n + k are. But this would solve the underlying instance of Set Cover, and therefore is impossible assuming P = NP.
Note that our inapproximability result holds in a very simple model, in which each node is “hard-wired” with a ﬁxed threshold.
Exploring the Boundaries of Approximability. Thus, the gen-
eral threshold and cascade models are too broad to allow for nontrivial approximation guarantees in their full generality. At the same time, we have seen that the greedy algorithm achieves strong guarantees for some of the main special cases in the social networks literature. How far can we extend these approximability results?
We can generalize the proof technique used in Theorems 2.2 and 2.5 to a model that is less general (and also less natural) than the general threshold and cascade models; however, it includes our special cases from Section 2, and every instance of this model will have a submodular inﬂuence function. The model is as follows.
• The Triggering Model. Each node v independently chooses a random “triggering set” Tv according to some distribution over subsets of its neighbors. To start the process, we target a set A for initial activation. After this initial iteration, an inactive node v becomes active in step t if it has a neighbor in its chosen triggering set Tv that is active at time t − 1. (Thus, v’s threshold has been replaced by a latent subset of Tv of neighbors whose behavior actually affects v.)
It is useful to think of the triggering sets in terms of “live” and “blocked” edges: if node u belongs to the triggering set Tv of v, then we declare the edge (u, v) to be live, and otherwise we declare it to be blocked. As in the proofs of Theorems 2.2 and 2.5, a node v is activated in an instance of the Triggering Model if and only if there is a live-edge path from the initially targeted set A to v. Following the arguments in these proofs, we obtain the following
THEOREM 4.2. In every instance of the Triggering Model, the inﬂuence function σ(·) is submodular.
Beyond the Independent Cascade and Linear Threshold, there are other natural special cases of the Triggering Model. One example is the “Only-Listen-Once” Model. Here, each node v has a parameter pv so that the ﬁrst neighbor of v to be activated causes v to become active with probability pv, and all subsequent attempts to activate v deterministically fail. (In other words, v only listens to the ﬁrst neighbor that tries to activate it.) This process has an equivalent formulation in the Triggering Set Model, with an edge distribution deﬁned as follows: for any node v, the triggering set Tv is either the entire neighbor set of v (with probability pv), or the empty set otherwise. As a result, the inﬂuence function in the Only-Listen-Once Model is also submodular, and we can obtain a (1 − 1/e − ε)-approximation here as well.
However, we can show that there exist models with submodular inﬂuence functions that do not have equivalent formulations in terms of triggering sets, so it makes sense to seek further models in which submodularity holds.
One tractable special case of the cascade model is based on the natural restriction that the probability of a node u inﬂuencing v is non-increasing as a function of the set of nodes that have previously tried to inﬂuence v. In terms of the cascade model, this means that pv(u, S) ≥ pv(u, T ) whenever S ⊆ T . We say that a process satisfying these conditions is an instance of the Decreasing Cascade Model. Although there are natural Decreasing Cascade instances that have no equivalent formulation in terms of triggering sets, we can show by a more intricate analysis that every instance of the Decreasing Cascade Model has a submodular inﬂuence function. We will include details of this proof in the full version of the paper.

A Conjecture. Finally, we state an appealing conjecture that would
include all the approximability results above as special cases.

CONJECTURE 4.3. Whenever the threshold functions fv at every node are monotone and submodular, the resulting inﬂuence function σ(·) is monotone and submodular as well.

It is not difﬁcult to show that every instance of the Triggering Model has an equivalent formulation with submodular node thresholds. Every instance of the Decreasing Cascade Model has such an equivalent formulation as well; in fact, the Decreasing Cascade condition stands as a very natural special case of the conjecture, given that it too is based on a type of “diminishing returns.” When translated into the language of threshold functions, we ﬁnd that the Decreasing Cascade condition corresponds to the following natural requirement:

fv (S

∪ {u}) − fv(S) 1 − fv(S)

≥

fv (T

∪ 1

{u}) − fv − fv(T )

(T

)

,

whenever S ⊆ T and u ∈/ T . This is in a sense a “normalized submodularity” property; it is stronger than submodularity, which would consist of the same inequality on just the numerators. (Note that by monotonicity, the denominator on the left is larger.)

5. NON-PROGRESSIVE PROCESSES
We have thus far been concerned with the progressive case, in which nodes only go from inactivity to activity, but not vice versa. The non-progressive case, in which nodes can switch in both directions, can in fact be reduced to the progressive case.
The non-progressive threshold process is analogous to the progressive model, except that at each step t, each node v chooses a new value θv(t) uniformly at random from the interval [0, 1]. Node v will be active in step t if fv(S) ≥ θv(t), where S is the set of neighbors of v that are active in step t − 1.
From the perspective of inﬂuence maximization, we can ask the following question. Suppose we have a non-progressive model that is going to run for τ steps, and during this process, we are allowed to make up to k interventions: for a particular node v, at a particular time t ≤ τ , we can target v for activation at time t. (v itself may quickly de-activate, but we hope to create a large “ripple effect.”) Which k interventions should we perform? Simple examples show that to maximize inﬂuence, one should not necessarily perform all k interventions at time 0; e.g., G may not even have k nodes.
Let A be a set of k interventions. The inﬂuence of these k interventions σ(A) is the sum, over all nodes v, of the number of time steps that v is active. The inﬂuence maximization problem in the non-progressive threshold model is to ﬁnd the k interventions with maximum inﬂuence.
We can show that the non-progressive inﬂuence maximization problem reduces to the progressive case in a different graph. Given a graph G = (V, E) and a time limit τ , we build a layered graph Gτ on τ · |V | nodes: there is a copy vt for each node v in G, and each time-step t ≤ τ . We connect each node in this graph with its neighbors in G indexed by the previous time step.
THEOREM 5.1. The non-progressive inﬂuence maximization problem on G over a time horizon τ is equivalent to the progressive inﬂuence maximization problem on the layered graph Gτ . Node v is active at time t in the non-progressive process if and only if vt is activated in the progressive process.
Thus, models where we have approximation algorithms for the progressive case carry over. Theorem 5.1 also implies approximation results for certain non-progressive models used by Asavathiratham et al. to model cascading failures in power grids [2, 3].

Note that the non-progressive model discussed here differs from
the model of Domingos and Richardson [10, 26] in two ways. We are concerned with the sum over all time steps t ≤ τ of the expected number of active nodes at time t, for a given a time limit τ , while [10, 26] study the limit of this process: the expected number of nodes active at time t as t goes to inﬁnity. Further, we consider interventions for a particular node v, at a particular time t ≤ τ , while the interventions considered by [10, 26] permanently affect the activation probability function of the targeted nodes.

6. GENERAL MARKETING STRATEGIES
In the formulation of the problem, we have so far assumed that for one unit of budget, we can deterministically target any node v for activation. This is clearly a highly simpliﬁed view. In a more realistic scenario, we may have a number m of different marketing actions Mi available, each of which may affect some subset of nodes by increasing their probabilities of becoming active, without necessarily making them active deterministically. The more we spend on any one action the stronger its effect will be; however, different nodes may respond to marketing actions in different ways,
In a general model, we choose investments xi into marketing actions Mi, such that the total investments do not exceed the budget. A marketing strategy is then an m-dimensional vector x of investments. The probability that node v will become active is determined by the strategy, and denoted by hv(x). We assume that this function is non-decreasing and satisﬁes the following “diminishing returns” property for all x ≥ y and a ≥ 0 (where we write x ≥ y or a ≥ 0 to denote that the inequalities hold in all coordinates):

hv(x + a) − hv(x) ≤ hv(y + a) − hv(y)

(1)

Intuitively, Inequality (1) states that any marketing action is more
effective when the targeted individual is less “marketing-saturated”
at that point.
We are trying to maximize the expected size of the ﬁnal active set. As a function of the marketing strategy x, each node v becomes active independently with probability hv(x), resulting in a (random) set of initial active nodes A. Given the initial set A, the expected size of the ﬁnal active set is σ(A). The expected revenue of the marketing strategy x is therefore

g(x) = A⊆V σ(A) · u∈A hu(x) · v∈/A(1 − hv(x)).

In order to (approximately) maximize g, we assume that we can

evaluate the function at any point x approximately, and ﬁnd a di-

rection i with approximately maximal gradient. Speciﬁcally, let ei denote the unit vector along the ith coordinate axis, and δ be some

constant. We assume that there exists some γ ≤ 1 such that we can

ﬁnd an i with g(x + δ · ei)−g(x) ≥ γ ·(g(x + δ · ej)−g(x)) for each j. We divide each unit of the total budget k into equal parts

of size δ. Starting with an all-0 investment, we perform an approx-

imate

gradient

ascent,

by

repeatedly

(a

of

k δ

times)

adding

δ

units of budget to the investment in the action Mi that approxi-

mately maximizes the gradient.

The proof that this algorithm gives a good approximation con-

sists of two steps. First, we show that the function g we are trying

to optimize is non-negative, non-decreasing, and satisﬁes the “di-

minishing returns” condition (1). Second, we show that the hill-

climbing algorithm gives a constant-factor approximation for any

function g with these properties. The latter part is captured by the

following theorem.

THEOREM 6.1. When the hill-climbing algorithm ﬁnishes with

g(xˆ),

where

xˆ denotes the optimal solution subject to i xˆi ≤ k.

The proof of this theorem builds on the analysis used by Nemhauser et al. [23], and we defer it to the full version of this paper.
With Theorem 6.1 in hand, it remains to show that g is nonnegative, monotone, and satisﬁes condition (1). The ﬁrst two are clear, so we only sketch the proof of the third. Fix an arbitary ordering of vertices. We then use the fact that for any ai, bi,

ai − bi =

(ai − bi) · aj · bj , (2)

i

j>i

and change the order of summation, to rewrite the difference

g(x + a) − g(x)

(hu(x + a) − hu(x)) ·

j<u,j∈A

j<u,j∈/A

hj (x) ·

(1 − hj (x)) .

j>u,j∈A

j>u,j∈/A

To show that this difference is non-increasing, we consider y ≤ x. From the diminishing returns property of hu(·), we obtain that hu(x + a) − hu(x) ≤ hu(y + a) − hu(y). Then, applying again
equation (2), changing the order of summation, and performing some tedious calculations, writing ∆(v, x, y) = hv(x + a) − hv(y + a) if v < u, and ∆(v, x, y) = hv(x) − hv(y) if v > u,
we obtain that

(g(x + a) − g(x)) − (g(y + a) − g(y))

≤

(hu(y + a) − hu(y)) · ∆(v, x, y) ·

u,v:u=v

In this expression, all terms are non-negative (by monotonicity of the hv(·)), with the exception of σ(A + {u, v}) − σ(A + u) − σ(A + v) + σ(A), which is non-positive because σ is submodular. Hence, the above difference is always non-positive, so g satisﬁes
the diminishing returns condition (1).
