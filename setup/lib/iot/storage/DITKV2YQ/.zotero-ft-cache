Abstractâ€” In UWAC (Underwater Acoustic Communications), underwater acoustic channels change rapidly due to various environment condition. AMC (Adaptive Modulation and Coding) technique is efficient method for improving the system efficiency by changing transmission parameters according to channel conditions in underwater acoustic channels. In this paper, we propose four modes and three threshold detection algorithms to determine the transmission mode in AMC technique. In transceiver model, convolutional coding is used to free the size of the information bits and turbo equalization is applied to improve the performance. In addition, the relationship between the modes and the threshold is analyzed through underwater experiments.

I. INTRODUCTION
Underwater acoustic channels fast varying according to environment condition such as propagation loss according to the distance of acoustic signals, interference signal caused by multipath propagation, background noise and Doppler effects that is related to a moving sound source or sea surface roughness [1-2]. The AMC (Adaptive Modulation and Coding) technique is attractive method for acoustic communication to improve the system efficiency by varying transmission parameters according to channel conditions. Furthermore, in communicating with multi-node networks, each node has different channel characteristics. In communicating with nodes, to get LPD (Low Probability of Detection) in military underwater communication environment, we assume there are no feedback information in order to select which transmission mode is used. In this paper, we construct four transmission modes with different data rates and modulation methods. Four different modes for same source data are transmitted in packet, on the receiver side, one critical component of AMC system is to find which mode has best

performance. In this paper, we also present threshold detection algorithm to decide appropriate mode. AMC experiment was conducted in the Mun-Kyeong Lake in May 2018 for different distance. We analyzed the performance of four modes based on threshold detection algorithm.
II. AMC MODEL AND THRESHOLD DETECTION METHOD
A. AMC Transceiver Model
In the underwater AMC system, we adopted convolutional coding to freely design the size of information bits [3]. Four modes are multiplexed and packetized. Each mode consisted of mode index field, preamble data field and coded modulation field. Preamble data field is used for acquiring synchronization and mode index field indicate which scheme is used for each mode. At the receiver side, after received packet, we analyze mode which is best performance by using threshold detection algorithm.
Figure 1 shows the structure of the AMC transceiver model. In others, as shown in Figure 1, to achieve low error performance, we resort to powerful BCJR decoding algorithms of convolutional codes for different modes [4]. We also employ an iterative turbo equalization method, equalizer and decoder are connected through the interleaving and de-interleaving functions that update each other's information recursively [5]. The interleaved output is canceled a posteriori from the proceeding received signal. The extrinsic information of the decoder is correction factor in order to compensate for the errors. As the number of iteration of turbo equalization increased, the updated error correction approached the original signal, which was to be transmitted, thereby improving the BER performance. Different transmit rates are produced by varying modulation scheme (BPSK/QPSK), convolutional code rate (1/3, 1/2), and the number of transmit element as shown in Table 1. The interleaver length is fixed on 120 and 240 using random interleaver.

locations. Data were collected at three sites at distance 100 [m], 250 [m], and 400 [m].

B. Threshold Detection Algorithm
Threshold detection parameters are very important part to decide which mode has best performance. This paper considered three kinds of method.
ï‚· First, PSNR (Pilot SNR) method is calculated SNR after channel estimation using the pilot signal or preamble symbols.
ï‚· Second, PES (Post Equalization SNR) method [6] is calculated from loot mean square errors from LMS (Least Mean Square) or RLS (Recursive Least Square) equalizer [7].
ï‚· Lastly, preamble error rate is used for deciding the packets are consisted of PN sequence and data field.
Using the uncoded PN sequence, the frequency and phase offset are estimated with Doppler and phase estimation algorithm. Estimated frequency and phase offset are fed to coded data field to compensate Doppler and phase offset. Usually PN sequence is utilized for acquiring synchronization information, the other hand the bit error rate of uncoded PN sequence predict performance of coded data field.

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We evaluate the performance of the AMC in real underwater environments. The experiment was conducted on a lake of MunKyeong city, Korea, in May 2018. The water depth was approximately 43[m]. Figure 2 shows depiction of lake trial. The source signal has 16 [kHz] center frequency and 1 [kbps] data rate. The hydrophone was equipped at 20 [m] lake bottom. The received signal was sampled at 192 [ kHz ] sampling frequency. Four modes AMC test was done at different

In Figure 3, each packet is preceded by a LFM (Linear Frequency Modulation) signal. The LFM followed by gap, training symbol and data package. At the front of the data package, a block of training symbols is used for timing synchronization and initial channel estimation. The whole packet is ended by another LFM signal, which was separated from the data package with a gap. During transmission, gaps that were sufficiently long were introduced among packets for avoiding inter-packet interference. The timing synchronization

IV. CONCLUSION
AMC technique is an attractive method for acoustic communication that improves system efficiency by changing transmission parameters according to channel conditions in rapidly changing underwater acoustic channel. In AMC technique, it is very important to select the transmission mode according to the channel environment. In this paper, four modes are constructed through convolutional code (1/2, 1/3) and modulation method (BPSK, QPSK). Also, we propose the three threshold detection algorithm to determine the transmission mode. We analyzed the relationship between four modes and three threshold algorithms through underwater experiment. We analyzed the optimal thresholds for each mode according to the RSNR, PES and PN BER. As a result, we estimated approximate thresholds in terms of RSNR, PES and PN BER for four modes. Based on these result, it is considered that more accurate threshold value can be determined by comprehensively considering the threshold values of RSNR, PES and PN BER.
