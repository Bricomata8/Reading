Abstractâ€” In this paper, we focus on the analysis of the rehealing delay incurred when restoring a network disconnection in a sparse vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) with unequal traffic on a bidirectional road. In previous works, equal vehicle traffic is assumed to simplify their analyses. To relax this limitation, we make proper revisions to one of the previous works. Numerical results are given to show the effect of unequal traffic on rehealing delay in a steady state.

Keywordsâ€”vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), rehealing delay, unequal vehicle traffic.
I. INTRODUCTION
Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are widely regarded as a promising wireless technology to realize intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Many of potential ITS applications, which include, e.g., safety warning [1], real-time route planning [2], etc., would rely heavily on message deliveries between vehicles, or vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. However, a VANET may suffer from network disconnections, especially during off-peak hours. When a network disconnection occurs, it can typically be restored by opposite-directional vehicles [3], [4], [5]. Due to the restoration, messages may inevitably incur rehealing delay [3], [4]. In either of [3], [4], [5], an analysis is thus performed to calculate the probability distribution of rehealing delay. However, all of them simply assume equal vehicle traffic intensity on a bidirectional road. Though the assumption could be acceptable during off-peak hours, unequal traffic would unarguably be deemed more general. Thus, we revise [4] to achieve this goal.

II. SYSTEM MODEL AND IMBEDDED MARKOV CHAIN

A. System model
We consider an east-west (E-W) bidirectional highway, with Poisson vehicle intensity í µí¼‡í µí¼‡ï¿½, í µí¼‡í µí¼‡ï¿½ (vehicles/m), respectively. Messages sent from an eastbound vehicle are destined for another eastbound vehicle traveling far behind. The delivery is primarily between eastbound vehicles; only when an eastbound network disconnection takes place can westbound vehicles participate in the restoration, which usually entails a store-carryforward process [3], [4], [5]. The range of a vehicle is í µí±…í µí±… (m) and it is assumed that vehicles travel at a fixed speed, í µí±‰í µí±‰ (m/s).

The occurrence probabilities of an eastbound and a westbound disconnection can respectively be obtained as

í µí¼í µí¼ï¿½ = âˆ«ï¿½ï¿½ í µí¼‡í µí¼‡ï¿½í µí±’í µí±’ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½í µí±‘í µí±‘í µí±‘í µí±‘ = í µí±’í µí±’ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½,

(1)

í µí¼í µí¼ï¿½ = âˆ«ï¿½ï¿½ í µí¼‡í µí¼‡ï¿½í µí±’í µí±’ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½í µí±‘í µí±‘í µí±‘í µí±‘ = í µí±’í µí±’ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.

(2)

Let í µí»¼í µí»¼ï¿½, í µí»¼í µí»¼ï¿½ be the lengths of an eastbound and a westbound disconnection, respectively, and their probability density functions (PDFs) can be expressed as

í µí±“í µï¿½í±“ ï¿½() = í µí¼‡í µí¼‡ï¿½í µí±’í µí±’ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½(ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½),  > í µí±…í µí±….

(3)

í µí±“í µï¿½í±“ ï¿½() = í µí¼‡í µí¼‡ï¿½í µí±’í µí±’ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½(ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½),  > í µí±…í µí±….

(4)

Same-directional vehicles form a cluster when any pair can communicate with each other via one-/multi-hop transmissions. Denote an eastbound and a westbound cluster length as í µí»½í µí»½ï¿½, í µí»½í µí»½ï¿½, respectively. Their PDFs are approximated as [3], [4]

í µí±“í µï¿½í±“ ï¿½() â‰ˆ í µí¼í µí¼ï¿½í µí»¿í µí»¿() + (1 âˆ’ í µí¼í µí¼ï¿½)í µí¼†í µí¼†ï¿½í µí±’í µí±’ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½,  â‰¥ 0, (5)

B. Imbedded Markov chain

In order to take the dependence into consideration of the restoration of a network disconnection on that of the previous one, like [4], we develop a mathematical framework utilizing an imbedded Markov chain. In the framework, í µí»±í µí»±ï¿½ is employed to record the system state pertaining to the ramifications of the restoration of the í µí±—í µí±—th network disconnection between í µí±†í µí±†ï¿½ and í µí°·í µí°·ï¿½, which is finished at time í µí±¡í µí±¡ = 0, as exhibited in Fig. 1. í µí»±í µí»±ï¿½ is a discrete random variable whose range equals the set, â„•, of all natural numbers. When í µí»±í µí»±ï¿½ = 0, the í µí±—í µí±—th restoration is similar to Fig. 1(a); on the other hand, when í µí»±í µí»±ï¿½ âˆˆ â„¤ï¿½, where â„¤ï¿½ is the set of all positive integers, it is like Figs. 1(b) or 1(c). Obviously, the rehealing delay í µí±‡í µï¿½í±‡ = 0 in the former, and í µí±‡í µï¿½í±‡ > 0 in the latter.

III. NUMERICAL ANALYSIS
Let Î© represent the westbound cluster helping to restore the í µí±—í µí±—th disconnection, and Î“ the westbound stretch affected by it.
When í µí»±í µí»±ï¿½ = 0, let í µí±í µí± be the partial length of Î© on the west of í µí°·í µí°·ï¿½ï¿½
at í µí±¡í µí±¡ = 0, where í µí°·í µí°·ï¿½ï¿½ denotes the east range of í µí°·í µí°·ï¿½. Therefore, the length of Î“, í µí»¾í µí»¾, amounts to í µí±…í µí±… plus í µí±í µí±, where í µí±…í µí±… accounts for the minimum spacing between two neighboring clusters. On the other hand, when í µí»±í µí»±ï¿½ âˆˆ â„¤ï¿½ , let í µí¼“í µí¼“ be the inter-cluster spacing between Î©ï¿½ and Î©ï¿½ï¿½, where Î©ï¿½, Î©ï¿½ï¿½ stand respectively for the leading vehicle of Î© and the vehicle immediately ahead of it. It is obvious that í µí»¾í µí»¾ = í µí¼“í µí¼“. Since í µí¼“í µí¼“ is clearly greater than í µí±…í µí±…, like [4], let í µí»±í µí»±ï¿½ = âŒˆí µí¼“í µí¼“ âˆ’ í µí±…í µí±…âŒ‰ , giving rise to í µí»±í µí»±ï¿½ âˆˆ â„¤ï¿½ . Note that our discussion hinges on the same speed assumption in Sec. II.A, which ensures network topology ever-unchanged in either direction. From the discussion, we can summarize

Fig. 2 shows relation between the locations of Î“ and the (í µí±—í µí±— + 1)th disconnection at í µí±¡í µí±¡ = 0. To facilitate our analysis, like [4], we introduce two auxiliary random variables, i.e., Î¦, Î˜. Figs. 2(a), 2(b), and 2(c) correspond to Î¦ = í µí¼™í µí¼™ï¿½, í µí¼™í µí¼™ï¿½ï¿½, í µí¼™í µí¼™ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, respectively. Denote í µí±í µí± the eastbound cluster length to which í µí±†í µí±†ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and í µí°·í µí°·ï¿½ both
belong, where í µí±†í µí±†ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ denotes the source vehicle of the (í µí±—í µí±— + 1)th disconnection, as shown in Fig. 2. Clearly, we have

í µí¼™í µí¼™ï¿½

í µí»¾í µí»¾ < í µí±í µí± + í µí±…í µí±…,

Î¦ = ï¿½ í µí¼™í µí¼™ï¿½ï¿½ í µí±í µí± + í µí±…í µí±… â‰¤ í µí»¾í µí»¾ â‰¤ í µí±í µí± + 2í µí±…í µí±…,

(8)

í µí¼™í µí¼™ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

í µí»¾í µí»¾ > í µí±í µí± + 2í µí±…í µí±….

On the other hand, Î˜ is used to indicate the relative location to í µí± í µí± ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ at í µí±¡í µí±¡ = 0 of the westbound vehicle that will relay messages to í µí±‘í µí±‘ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. If it is to its west, Î˜ = í µí¼ƒí µí¼ƒï¿½; otherwise, Î˜ = í µí¼ƒí µí¼ƒï¿½.

The transition probability from ï¿½ = í µí±ší µí±š to ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = í µí±›í µí±›, which constitutes the (í µí±ší µí±š, í µí±›í µí±›)th entry of í µí±·í µí±·, can thus be expressed as
í µí±ƒí µí±ƒï¿½Î ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = í µí±›í µí±›ï¿½Î ï¿½ = í µí±ší µí±š, Î¦ = í µí¼™í µí¼™, Î˜ = í µí¼ƒí µí¼ƒï¿½ Ã—
í µí±í µí±ï¿½ï¿½ = âˆ‘ï¿½,ï¿½,ï¿½ ï¿½ í µí±ƒí µí±ƒï¿½Î˜ = í µí¼ƒí µí¼ƒï¿½Î ï¿½ = í µí±ší µí±š, Î¦ = í µí¼™í µí¼™ï¿½ Ã— ï¿½.
í µí±ƒí µí±ƒï¿½Î¦ = í µí¼™í µí¼™ï¿½Î ï¿½ = í µí±ší µí±šï¿½ (9)

The conditional probabilities of (9) are each calculated in the following. After í µí±·í µí±· is found, the probability distribution, í µí½…í µí½…, of ï¿½ in a steady state can be obtained by solving simultaneously

í µí½…í µí½… = í µí½…í µí½…,

(10)

âˆ‘ï¿½ í µí¼‹í µí¼‹ï¿½ = 1,

(11)

where í µí½…í µí½… = (í µí¼‹í µí¼‹ï¿½, í µí¼‹í µí¼‹ï¿½, â‹¯ ) and í µí¼‹í µí¼‹ï¿½ = Pï¿½ï¿½ = í µí±–í µí±–ï¿½ in a steady state.

A. í µí±ƒí µí±ƒï¿½í µí»·í µí»· = í µí¼™í µí¼™ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = í µí¼‹í µí¼‹ï¿½

Let í µí»¿í µí»¿ = í µí±í µí± âˆ’ í µí±í µí± . Due to the memoryless property for a nonzero cluster length in both (5) and (6), the conditional PDF of í µí»¿í µí»¿, given í µí»¹í µí»¹ï¿½ = {í µí±í µí± > 0, í µí±í µí± > 0}, can be expressed as

(12)

Because í µí»¾í µí»¾ = í µí±í µí± + í µí±…í µí±… when ï¿½ = 0 from (7), the conditional probability can be calculated as

Pï¿½Î¦ = í µí¼™í µí¼™ï¿½ï¿½Î ï¿½ = 0ï¿½ = P{í µí»¾í µí»¾ < í µí±í µí± + í µí±…í µí±…|í µí±í µí± > 0} = P{í µí±í µí± + í µí±…í µí±… < í µí±í µí± + í µí±…í µí±…|í µí±í µí± > 0}

On the other hand, í µí»¾í µí»¾ = í µí¼‹í µí¼‹ + í µí±…í µí±… when ï¿½ = í µí¼‹í µí¼‹ âˆˆ â„¤ï¿½ from (7).
Clearly, í µí±í µí±, ï¿½ are independent as they are in opposite directions. The conditional probability can thus be computed as
Pï¿½Î¦ = í µí¼™í µí¼™ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = í µí¼‹í µí¼‹ âˆˆ â„¤ï¿½ï¿½ = Pï¿½í µí±í µí± > í µí¼‹í µí¼‹ï¿½ï¿½ = í µí¼‹í µí¼‹ï¿½

B. í µí±ƒí µí±ƒï¿½í µí»·í µí»· = í µí¼™í µí¼™ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = í µí¼‹í µí¼‹ï¿½

Let í µí¼í µí¼ = í µí»¾í µí»¾ âˆ’ (í µí±í µí± + í µí±…í µí±…). From (7), it can be rewritten as

ï¿½ = 0, the conditional PDF can thus be obtained as

Fig. 3 shows relation between random variables when Î¦ =

í µí¼™í µí¼™ï¿½ . As depicted, since Î“ is all to the west of í µí±†í µí±†ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ , it is

independent of whether Î˜ = í µí¼ƒí µí¼ƒï¿½ or Î˜ = í µí¼ƒí µí¼ƒï¿½. Thus, âˆ€í µí¼‹í µí¼‹ âˆˆ â„•, the conditional probabilities can be written as

Pï¿½Î˜ = í µí¼ƒí µí¼ƒï¿½ï¿½í µí»±í µí»±ï¿½ = í µí¼‹í µí¼‹, Î¦ = í µí¼™í µí¼™ï¿½ï¿½ = 1 âˆ’ í µí±’í µí±’ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½,

Fig. 4 shows relation between random variables when Î¦ =

í µí¼™í µí¼™ï¿½ï¿½. As shown, the west edge of Î“ extends well beyond í µí±†í µí±†ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½,

though it is still inside the west range of í µí±†í µí±†ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, denoted as ï¿½í µí±†í µí±†ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.

When í µí¼‹í µí¼‹ = 0, there exist no westbound vehicles between the

west edge of Î“ and í µí±†í µí±†ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. Let í µí°¾í µí°¾ be the westbound vehicle to the

west of and nearest the west edge of Î“ at í µí±¡í µí±¡ = 0, and í µí±˜í µí±˜ be the

distance between them. It is clear that if í µí¼‰í µí¼‰ = í µí±˜í µí±˜ + í µí¼í µí¼ < í µí±…í µí±…, Î˜ =

í µí¼ƒí µí¼ƒï¿½; otherwise, Î˜ = í µí¼ƒí µí¼ƒï¿½. To calculate the conditional probability that í µí¼‰í µí¼‰ < í µí±…í µí±…, we need

to obtain the conditional PDF of í µí¼í µí¼, which can be computed as

í µí±“í µï¿½í±“ |ï¿½ï¿½,ï¿½(í µí±¥í µí±¥|0,

The conditional PDF of í µí¼‰í µí¼‰ can thus be expressed as

í µí±“í µï¿½í±“ |ï¿½ï¿½,ï¿½(í µí±¥í µí±¥|0, í µí¼™í µí¼™ï¿½ï¿½) = ï¿½í µí±“í µï¿½í±“ |ï¿½ï¿½,ï¿½ âˆ— í µí±“í µï¿½í±“ ï¿½ (í µí±¥í µí±¥|0, í µí¼™í µí¼™ï¿½ï¿½),

where í µí±¥í µí±¥ > 0 and (í µí±“í µï¿½í±“ âˆ— í µí±“í µï¿½í±“ ) denotes the convolution of í µí±“í µï¿½í±“ and í µí±“í µï¿½í±“ .

On the other hand, when í µí¼‹í µí¼‹ âˆˆ â„¤ï¿½ , there is a westbound

vehicle right at the west edge of Î“. Since the westbound vehicle

is between í µí±†í µí±†ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and ï¿½í µí±†í µí±†ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, it is clear that

Pï¿½Î˜ = í µí¼ƒí µí¼ƒï¿½ï¿½í µí»±í µí»±ï¿½ = í µí¼‹í µí¼‹, Î¦ = í µí¼™í µí¼™ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = 1,

Fig. 5 shows relation between random variables when Î¦ =

í µí¼™í µí¼™ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, where Î“ is beyond í µí±†í µí±†ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, and its west edge is outside ï¿½í µí±†í µí±†ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.

When í µí¼‹í µí¼‹ = 0, though there exists an empty stretch of length

í µí±…í µí±… inside and at the west end of Î“, it is clear that the leading

vehicle of Î© is to the west of í µí±†í µí±†ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ at í µí±¡í µí±¡ = 0. Therefore, we have

Pï¿½Î˜ = í µí¼ƒí µí¼ƒï¿½ï¿½í µí»±í µí»±ï¿½ = 0, Î¦ = í µí¼™í µí¼™ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = 1,

(29)

On the other hand, when í µí¼‹í µí¼‹ > í µí±…í µí±…, there exist no westbound

vehicles between the leading vehicle of Î© and the westbound

vehicle at the west edge of Î“, where the former should be right

at í µí°·í µí°·ï¿½ï¿½ at í µí±¡í µí±¡ = 0 and the latter should be outside the west range

of í µí±†í µí±†ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. Therefore,

Pï¿½Î˜ = í µí¼ƒí µí¼ƒï¿½ï¿½í µí»±í µí»±ï¿½ = í µí¼‹í µí¼‹, Î¦ = í µí¼™í µí¼™ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = 0,

As displayed in Fig. 3, when Î˜ = í µí¼ƒí µí¼ƒï¿½ , the (í µí±—í µí±— + 1) th restoration is clearly independent of Î“. Let í µí°»í µí°» be the westbound

vehicle to the west of and nearest to Sï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, â„ be the distance separating them, í µí±”í µí±” the cluster length to which í µí°»í µí°» belongs, and

í µí°ºí µí°º the leading vehicle of the cluster. It is clear that if í µí±‹í µí±‹ = í µí± í µí±  âˆ’ â„ âˆ’ í µí±”í µí±” âˆ’ í µí±…í µí±… > 0, í µí±‹í µí±‹ is the distance í µí°ºí µí°º needs to travel in order to

restore the (í µí±—í µí±— + 1) th disconnection whose length is í µí± í µí±  ;

otherwise, í µí±‡í µï¿½í±‡ ï¿½ï¿½ = 0, and í µí»±í µí»±ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = 0.

In order to calculate the PDF of í µí±‹í µí±‹, we first calculate the PDF

of í µí± í µí± ï¿½ = (í µí± í µí±  âˆ’ í µí±…í µí±…), which can readily be obtained from (3) as

As shown in Fig. 3, denote í µí°¶í µí°¶ the westbound vehicle to the

of Î“ to í µí±†í µí±†ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ at í µí±¡í µí±¡ = 0 , í µí±‹í µí±‹ = í µí±í µí± + í µí± í µí± ï¿½ ; otherwise, the (í µí±—í µí±— + 1) th

restoration must resort to the leading vehicle of Î“; as a result,

í µí±‹í µí±‹ = í µí± í µí± ï¿½ + í µí±‘í µí±‘ + í µí±…í µí±… for í µí»±í µí»±ï¿½ = 0 and í µí±‹í µí±‹ = í µí± í µí± ï¿½ + í µí±‘í µí±‘ for í µí»±í µí»±ï¿½ âˆˆ â„¤ï¿½.

First, í µí±‘í µí±‘ = (í µí±í µí± + í µí±…í µí±…) âˆ’ í µí»¾í µí»¾ > 0, as can be seen in Fig. 3. The

The conditional marginal PDF of í µí±í µí± for í µí±í µí± < í µí±‘í µí±‘ can be found as

On the other hand, the conditional marginal PDF of í µí±‘í µí±‘ for í µí±í µí± >

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

In this section, analytic and simulation results of the CDF of rehealing delay are compared. Analytic results are calculated using MATLAB Symbolic Toolbox, whereas their simulation counterparts are each obtained from 1,000,000 independent samples. Three different scenarios are considered, including Î¼ï¿½/Î¼ï¿½ = 0.02/0.01, 0.01/0.01, and 0.01/0.02 . Relevant system parameters include R = 250 m, V = 30 (m/s).

P(T t)

Fig. 6. The CDF of rehealing delay í µí±‡í µí±‡ in a steady state.
Fig. 6 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of rehealing delay T in a steady state. As displayed, when Î¼ï¿½/Î¼ï¿½ = 0.01/0.01, P{í µí±‡í µí±‡ = 0} in the steady state is the lowest among the three different scenarios considered. However, when Î¼ï¿½/Î¼ï¿½ = 0.02/0.01 or 0.01/0.02 , P{í µí±‡í µí±‡ = 0} in the steady state increases. This suggests that the increase of intensity in either direction can help to increase the chance of a network disconnection being restored without incurring any rehealing delay, like the one in Fig. 1(a). Comparing further between Î¼ï¿½/Î¼ï¿½ = 0.02/0.01 and 0.01/0.02, raising the intensity in the opposite direction have a more significant effect on lowering í µí±‡í µí±‡.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we analyze the rehealing delay incurred when restoring a network disconnection in a sparse vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) with unequal traffic on a bidirectional road. In our analysis, in order to taking the dependence into account of the restoration of a disconnection on that of the previous one, an imbedded Markov chain is utilized to keep track of the system state. Numerical results demonstrate the excellent accuracy of our analysis; in addition, increasing the intensity of the opposite directional traffic is more effective on reducing rehealing delay than increasing that of the same directional one.
