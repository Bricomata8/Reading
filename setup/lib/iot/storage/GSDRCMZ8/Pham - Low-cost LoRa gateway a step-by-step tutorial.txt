Low-cost LoRa gateway: a step-by-step tutorial
Prof. Congduc Pham
http://www.univ-pau.fr/~cpham Université de Pau, France

Contents
q This tutorial targets user who want to better understand the architecture of the low-cost LoRa gateway. The device part will be shown in a separate tutorial
q The hardware platform is a Raspberry PI. RPI 1B/B+, 2B and 3B have been successfully tested
q For end-users, the tutorial on the web admin interface is more adapted
q It is also necessary to read information from
q https://github.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw q https://github.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw/tree/m
aster/gw_full_latest
q As there are many issues that are not described here q Let’s get started…
2

Assembling the hardware
3

Get the Raspberry
You can use RaspberryPI 1 model B or B+, RaspberryPI 2 model B, RaspberryPI 3 model B and RaspberryPI Zero (W). The most important usefull feature is the Ethernet interface for easy Internet connection. You can add WiFi with a WiFi USB dongle to use access-point features. With the RPI3 & RPI0W, WiFi and Bluetooth are embedded on the board.

CS GND

Now the radio module (1)
If you go for the inAir (9,9B,4) from Modtronix, the header pins can come fully assembled. Take the 6mm header pins to have enough length to connect F/F breadboard cables (left). Connect the SPI pins with the F/F cables. Try to use different colors. I use the following colors: MOSI (blue), MISO (green), CS (white), CLK (orange). Then connect also the VCC (red) and the GND (black or any other dark color) of the radio board.

MOSI MISO CLK VCC

Now the radio module (2)

MISO MOSI CLK CS

GND VCC

If you take the HopeRF RFM 92W/95W you may need the adaptor breakout and to go though some delicate but simple soldering tasks! It is not difficult but you have to trained a bit before! Then, like for the inAir9, use F/F breadboard cable to connect the SPI pins, using different colors as explained previously.

Another breakout from Tindie https://www.tindie.com/products/leon ahi/rfm95-lora-breakout-board/

Another breakout from

https://github.com/ccadic/RFM95LORA_Breadboard

CS GND

Connecting the radio module (1)
Depending on the model, you can have the « short » or the « long » GPIO interface. However, the SPI pins are at the same location therefore it does not change the way you connect the radio module if you take pin 1 as the reference. Connect the SPI pins (MOSI, MISO, CLK, CS) of the radio to the corresponding pins on the RPI. Note that CS goes to CE0_N on the RPI.
7

MOSI MISO CLK VCC

Connecting the radio module (2)
It is strongly advised to also connect the RESET pin (RT) to the RPI's #11 pin (GPIO17)
8

RT CS GND

MOSI MISO CLK VCC

Freely available RFM95W breakout
q We also propose a very simple RFM95W breakout that can be used for gateway and end-device

q The zipped Gerber archive can be

freely downloaded from

https://github.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw

9

The WaziHat PCB
q WAZIUP has also a simple RFM95W breakout for the gateway
q Contact A. Rahim (arahim"at"fbk.eu) for more information
The short WAZIHAT version can be used for end-device as well
10

The LoRasPI hat
q The LoRasPI hat from https://github.com/hallard/LoRasPI
11

Put it in a box (1)
You can have a more integrated version, with a box for outdoor usage and PoE splitter to power the Raspberry with the Ethernet cable. See how we also use a DC-DC converter to get the 5V for the RPI.
12

Put it in a box (2)
A simple, cheap and funny box is also very suitable for an indoor gateway. Actually, indoor deployment is probably the best option with an outdoor antenna as it will be shown in next slides.
13

Antennas for gateway
q Antennas for gateways can be placed on a building, at a high location.
q You can easily use ground plane or dipole antennas (e.g. sleeve dipole). More complex high gain antenna or a directional Yagi antenna can be purchased depending on your budget and whether the deployment allows it.
14

using a cable antenna
q Using an extension coaxial cable between the antenna and the radio module greatly ease the deployment of the gateway but:
q Take a good quality cable (e.g. RG58 minimum) to limit attenuation
q The antenna cable should not be too long to avoid high attenuation: 2m-5m
q A simple ¼ wave monopole antenna WILL NOT provide good performance, TAKE a sleeve dipole if you need something compact
Look at the antenna cable tutorial for instructions on how to build your own cable (with adequate connectors) at the correct length.
15

Antenna with a coaxial cable
q At the end of a coaxial cable, it is possible to connect a ground plane antenna (usually ¼ wave) or a ½ wave dipole antenna.

Ground plane Sleeve dipole

Simple dipole

More complex: collinear, array,…

q Some of them are easy to build (ground plane

and simple dipole) and there are many tutorials.

16

Simple ½ wave dipole antenna
q A very simple dipole can be made with 2 pieces of ¼ wave wires. ¼ wave in 868MHz is about 8.2cm.
q There is no balun here but it is still better than the ¼ wave monople if a coaxial cable is used
q You can buy a 3m RG58 cable (SMA-m to SMA-f for instance), keep the male side, cut the female side and solder the core conductor and the braid as shown. 17

Simple ¼ wave ground plane antenna
q The ground plane antenna can be made with 5 pieces of ¼ wave wires. ¼ wave in 868MHz is about 8.2cm.
q You can buy a 3m-5m RG58 cable with an SMA-male at one end and a male N-connector at the other end. Or build your own cable. 18

Even simpler ¼ wave ground plane antenna
q With an existing SMA-m/SMA-f cable, you can also build a ground plane antenna by adding 4 radiant wires to the ¼ wave monopole.
q This is a cheaper solution for sensing devices

Getting, compiling & installing the software
21

Flashing the OS
http://cpham.perso.univ-pau.fr/LORA/WAZIUP/raspberrypi-jessie-WAZIUP-demo.dmg.zip
q An SD card image with a Raspberry Raspbian Jessie version is provided.
q You will need an 8GB SD card. Be careful, some SD cards will not work. This one has been successfully tested. It has to be class 10.
q Look at https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/inst allation/installing-images/ to see the procedure depending on your OS. 7948206080 bytes should be written, otherwise you may have a problem.
q Once flashed, insert the SD card and power-up the Raspberry-based gateway.
22

Gateway web admin interface (1)
q A gateway web admin interface has been added to the latest version
q Note that the SD card image includes the web admin interface installed, so you may skip the installation procedure (but it is strongly advised to update)
q To install the web admin interface, check if you have the gw_web_admin folder in your lora_gateway folder
q If you don't, then update to the latest version q Then, go into gw_web_admin and run install.sh
q cd gw_web_admin q sudo ./install.sh
q Web admin interface tutorial:
https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/ Low-cost-LoRa-GW-web-admin.pdf
23

Gateway web admin interface (2)
q http://192.168.200.1/admin
q Login: admin q Password: loragateway
24

Web admin features

q Currently, you can use the web admin to:

q Update your gateway with the latest github version while preserving your configuration files

q Perform the basic configuration procedure

q Configure the gateway as WiFi client to connect to a WiFi network

q Test Internet connectivity

q Easily reboot and shutdown your gateway

• Be carefull, if you shut down the gateway, you need to physically access the gateway to power it it on again

q Change LoRa mode and frequency

q Set your gateway id and configure alerting system (mail, SMS)

q Change the WiFi SSID and password

q Enable/Disable local AES decryption

q Enable/Disable some selected clouds such as WAZIUP and ThingSpeak

q For ThingSpeak, you can specify a new write key

q For WAZIUP, you can specify the project name, the organization

name, the service tree, the user name,…

25

Gateway update
q The gateway must be updated to the latest version
q Internet access for the gateway is necessary q The update procedure can easily be done with
the web admin interface, connect to the gateway WiFi first q The update steps are
1. Full Update 2. Basic Config 3. Update Web Interface
q We recommend using the web interface for updates
26

Gateway update page

q Gateway update section
Can download and install a file in the lora_gateway folder. A link to a file should be provided, e.g. a Dropbox link

Update the web admin interface after an update of the distribution to install the last version of the web admin interface.
It is recommended to run UUppddaatteewweebbaaddmminin right after FFuullluuppddaattee or NNeewwiinnssttaalllaattiioonn. Then reload the page.
3

Install a new gateway by removing the existing lora_gateway folder, all existing configuration files will be overwritten.
If you install a new gateway with our SD card image, you can use this option.

1
Update with latest version on github, all your configuration files will be kept. This is the recommended option.

2
Compile and configure the gateway (to set the gateway id & the WiFi access point SSID). This is also required if you install a new gateway using the provided SD card image. It is recommended to run BBaassicicccoonnffigig right after Full update or NNeewwininsstatallalatitoionn.
27

Software version number
q The software version number on github and the installed version number are displayed
q Click on to obtain the latest software version number on github
28

Manual new install of gateway directly from github

The software should be installed in a lora_gateway folder. Delete any previous folder.

> rm -rf lora_gateway

then

> mkdir lora_gateway

> git clone https://github.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw.git

> cp -r LowCostLoRaGw/gw_full_latest/* lora_gateway/

or

> svn checkout https://github.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw/trunk/gw_full_latest lora_gateway

29

Manually compiling the GW software
> cd lora_gateway > make lora_gateway g++ -DRASPBERRY -DIS_RCV_GATEWAY -c lora_gateway.cpp -o lora_gateway.o g++ -c arduPi.cpp -o arduPi.o g++ -c SX1272.cpp -o SX1272.o g++ -lrt -lpthread lora_gateway.o arduPi.o SX1272.o -o lora_gateway
Edit radio.makefile for PABOOST setting. If inAir9B, RFM92W/FM95W, NiceRF1272, uncomment:
CFLAGS=-DPABOOST If inAir9/inAir4, Libelium SX1272, leave commented:
#CFLAGS=-DPABOOST
If you have a RPI 2 or RPI3, then type:
> make lora_gateway_pi2
30

Manual new install of gateway
using update_gw.sh script (1)
q Alternatively, the gateway can also be installed/updated to the latest version with the update_gw.sh script (this script is called by the web interface).
q The first step is to get the latest version of the > cud pdate script
> svn checkout https://github.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw/trunk/gw_full_latest/scripts > cd scripts > ll total 48 -rw-r--r-- 1 pi pi 3561 May 10 17:31 bashrc.sh -rwxr-xr-x 1 pi pi 10562 May 10 17:31 config_gw.sh -rw-r--r-- 1 pi pi 230 May 10 17:31 interfaces_ap -rwxr-xr-x 1 pi pi 99 May 10 17:31 mnt-dropbox -rwxr-xr-x 1 pi pi 610 May 10 17:31 mongodb_repair.sh -rwxr-xr-x 1 pi pi 816 May 10 17:31 start_access_point.sh -rwxr-xr-x 1 pi pi 57 May 10 17:31 start_gw.sh -rwxr-xr-x 1 pi pi 673 May 10 17:31 stop_access_point.sh -rwxr-xr-x 1 pi pi 37 May 10 17:31 unmnt-dropbox -rwxr-xr-x 1 pi pi 1537 May 10 17:31 update_gw.sh
31

Manual new install of gateway
using update_gw.sh script (2)
q It is also possible to get only this script
q wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoR aGw/master/gw_full_latest/scripts/update_gw.sh
q Then type the following commands
q rm –rf lora_gateway q ./update_gw.sh
q Removing any previous lora_gateway folder triggers a new install
q The gateway will obtain the latest distribution from our github repository and will create a new lora_gateway folder
q A full update without deleting the existing lora_gateway folder preserves existing configuration files
32

Connecting to gateway & configuration options
q There are 2 configuration interfaces
q The web admin interface q The command line interface that needs ssh
q The web interface is sufficient for most users
q Easy basic configuration and easy update q Pre-defined cloud configuration q dedicated tutorial:
https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/mast er/Low-cost-LoRa-GW-web-admin.pdf
q The command line interface has some more options and can easily be extended
q We are going to describe the command line interface and some of the gateway's internal
33

SSH to the gateway
q The provided SD image sets the Raspberry for DHCP on wired Ethernet and as a WiFi access point.
q If you connected the gateway to your LAN or laptop using wired Ethernet then the gateway will be assigned an IP address. Use this address to connect with SSH to the gateway
q You can use Angry IP Scanner (http://angryip.org/) to know the assigned address
q Use ssh pi@rpi_addr, where rpi_addr is the IP address assigned to the gateway
q Login password is loragateway if you installed from the SD card image
q However, using the built-in WiFi access point is easier as shown in the next slide
34

SSH to the gateway with WiFi

q The gateway is also configured as a WiFi access point with address 192.168.200.1

q Select the WAZIUP_PI_GW_xxxxxxxxxx WiFi

q WiFi password is loragateway q Then ssh pi@192.168.200.1 q Login password is loragateway

You can use an iOS or Android smartphone or tablet to connect to the gateway with an SSH client app! See next slide.

35

Using iOS/Android smartphone or tablet
q On iOS we tested Termius q On Android we tested JuiceSSH
36

Gateway's simple command interface

q Once logged on the gateway, you may directly enter in a simple command interface
q This command interface consists in a cmd.sh shell script
q In image versions after May 2017, this script is launched when you log into the gateway with ssh
q If this happens, select Q and hit RETURN to quit this interface
q You should be in the lora_gateway folder

gateway startup procedure
q The gateway software is launched when the Raspberry is powered on, i.e. booting
q /home/pi/lora_gateway/scripts/start_gw.sh which starts the gateway has been added in /etc/rc.local
q start_gw.sh performs some initial tasks and finally runs python /home/pi/lora_gateway/start_gw.py
q start_gw.py parses the configuration files to launch the low-level gateway (lora_gateway), the post-processing stage (post_processing_gw.py) and the log service
q The gateway works by default in LoRa mode 1 (BW=125kHz, SF=12) and listen on frequency 865.2MHz (see https://github.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw#ann exa-lora-mode-and-predefined-channels)
q The gateway_conf.json file contains the gateway configuration
38

gateway_conf.json
q The gateway_conf.json file contains the gateway configuration
Set "mode" to -1 if you want to use bw, cr and sf parameters
Set "ch" to a channel number if you don't want to use the default channel (which is channel 10 in the 868 band channel 05 in 900 band and channel 00 in the 433 band).
Set "freq" to a frequency, e.g. 865.2, if you want to specify a given frequency, "freq" has priority over "ch"
39

Default configuration
\!##TC/18.5
#define DEFAULT_DEST_ADDR 1 #define LORAMODE 1 #define node_addr 6
The default configuration in the Arduino_LoRa_Simple_temp example is: Send packets to the gateway (one or many if in range) LoRa mode 1 & Node short address is 6 The default gateway configuration is also LoRa mode 1
40

Check that the gateway is running
q Use option 3 of the text interface
q IMPORTANT NOTICE: Do not launch a new gateway instance with an existing one as there will be conflict on the SPI bus.
41

Configuring the gateway
q Go into the scripts folder in the newly created lora_gateway folder
q Run the basic_config_gw.sh script
q ./basic_config_gw.sh
q The script will get the hardware address of the gateway to define the gateway'id, using the last 5 bytes of the MAC address
q ifconfig

q It will also compile the low-level gateway software, remember to

check compilation options of radio.makefile

q If you need advanced configuration, use config_gw and follow

the instructions as shown in the next slides otherwise you are all

done

Gateway's ID
q The gateway's ID is derived from the RPI MAC address, using the last 5 bytes
q Here the gateway's ID is 00000027EB795C47 q This information is stored in gateway_id.txt and in
gateway_conf.json
q "gateway_conf": { "gateway_ID":"00000027EB795C47", …
q basic_config_gw.sh also builds the MD5 hash version of the gateway's ID and stores it in gateway_id.md5
q The ID is re-created at boot so that a newly installed gateway has the correct ID
q It is recommended to use this default gateway ID 45

Start the command line interface

> ./cmd.sh
As you can see, the gateway id shown by the command interface is now correct

Starting the gateway
q Remember that the gateway software is launched when the Raspberry is powered on
q In the next 4 slides, we will show you some details that is useful to know but that you DO NOT need when launching a production gateway
q If you use our SD card image and powered on your Raspberry, then you can use option 3 as explained in slide 37 to see if the gateway is running, then use option K to kill all gatewayrelated process to test the next 4 slides.
53

pushing to IoT data clouds
q A message starting with ’\!’ is uploaded on a cloud q clouds.json file defines enabled clouds
For each cloud, you have to provide a script and the launcher program (e.g. python) Enabled clouds will be called by the post-processing stage
60

Example with WAZIUP cloud
q To use the WAZIUP cloud:
q Edit and modify clouds.json according to your need
q CloudWAZIUP.py script will use information from key_WAZIUP.py to configure data management for each organization
q Therefore you need to configure this file for each organization/gateway

Rebooting the gateway
q Your gateway is now updated and configured q You can now reboot the gateway
q After reboot, check the WiFi SSID which now should meet your gateway's id
q In general, try to avoid unplugging power cable to shutdown your gateway. Use the web admin interface instead
q Your gateway is now ready to be deployed.
69

Customizing/Extending your gateway

q The flexible gateway architecture offers high versatility by customization

q There are 4 alternatives for customization

q The geek way

q Modify/extend post-processing script

q The "smarter" way

Cloud definition

q Add "cloud" scripts

cloud_script_1

• On packet reception

q Add low rate periodic tasks

cloud_script_2

• Independant from packet reception
q Add fast rate statistic-oriented tasks

radio bridge program

stdout

post

stdout

processing

stdin

Handle downlink

AES
encryption decryption

LoRaWAN interoperability

Incoming data parsing block

Periodic task

Add your own cloud script
q Use our templates to write your own cloud script
q CloudWAZIUP.py, CloudMongoDB.py, CloudThingSpeak.py, CloudGroveStreams.py, CloudNoInternet.py, CloudNodeRed.py, …
q A cloud script is called with 5 arguments
These parameters are passed to the script. It is up to the cloud script to use these parameters or not. 71

Example with Node-Red
q CloudNodeRed.py shows how interface with Node-Red can be simply implemented to benefit from the facility offered by Node-Red
q We use key_NodeRed.py to define 3 variables that will be used by CloudNodeRed.py
q project_name="waziup" q organization_name="UPPA" q sensor_name="Sensor"
q when a device which address is 2 sends "TC/22.5/HU/85" to the gateway, CloudNodeRed.py will generate the following json entries in nodered/nodered.txt file
q {"source":"waziup_UPPA_Sensor2","measure":"TC","value":22.5} q {"source":"waziup_UPPA_Sensor2","measure":"HU","value":85}
72

Node-Red flow (1)
q The Node-Red flow is composed of a tail node that follows the nodered/nodered.txt file for new entries. Each entry will be converted into a json object with a json node. A function node will use the json entry to build a message as follows
q msg.topic=msg.payload.source+'/'+msg.payload.measure q msg.payload=msg.payload.value q return msg;
73

Node-Red flow (2)
q An MQTT node using the test.mosquitto.org broker will receive the messages with the topic defined as waziup_UPPA_Sensor2/TC and waziup_UPPA_Sensor2/HU
q It will then respectively publish 22.5 and 85 under these topics
q More information on:
q https://github.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw/blob/master /gw_full_latest/README-NodeRed.md
74

Add your own low-rate periodic task
q post_processing_gw.py periodically calls post_status_processing_gw.py based on the value defined by "status" (in seconds)
q A value of 0 disables periodic status tasks q You can add your own periodic tasks in
post_status_processing_gw.py q Currently, the only periodic task is to get the GPS position
of the gateway (from a USB GPS module) in a dynamic manner for mobilty scenarios q You can use the status_conf section of gateway_conf.json to add whatever you need to control your periodic tasks q post_status_processing_gw.py provides examples on how you can add new tasks
75

Add your own fast-rate periodic task
q post_processing_gw.py calls stats.py every 5s (hardcoded)
q stats.py is mainly based on Adafruit example to display on a small OLED screen some RPI statistics
https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pioled-128x32-minioled-for-raspberry-pi/usage
q We added the display of the last received packet's statistics
q You can add other stats but beware that it is a fast rate stats service so avoid time consuming tasks or printing to Linux stdout
76

Connect a small OLED screen to your gateway
q A small I2C OLED screen can be connected to the RPI and it will be driven by the fast rate stats service
q Just connect 3.3v/5V, GND, SDA, SCL q You can hot-(un)plug the OLED at any time, convenient for
fast debugging/tests
77

Standalone gateway
78

Connect to the embedded web data server
q Received data are also stored on the gateway if CloudMongoDB.py is enabled
q On the WiFi interface
q Gateway address is 192.168.200.1
q On the Ethernet interface
q Gateway address is the IP address assigned by the DHCP server (of your LAN or laptop)
q Choose any of these solutions and open a web browser to enter the gateway IP address in the URL bar
q http://192.168.200.1
