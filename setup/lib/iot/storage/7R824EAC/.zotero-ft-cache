Abstractâ€” Information reconciliation is a critical process of any Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol, where two legitimate parties agree on a secret key. Two parties attempt to eliminate the discrepancies between their correlated keys in the presence of an adversary, while revealing a minimum amount of information. In this paper, we propose a reconciliation protocol using polar codes with a soft-output decoder. We demonstrate that our method is better than a conventional protocol using polar codes in the view of reconciliation efficiency.

I. INTRODUCTION
Quantum cryptography or more precisely quantum key distribution (QKD) is a new technology which gets a high level of attention today worldwide. The idea of QKD is first proposed by C.H. Bennett, G. Brassard in 1984[1].
QKD is a secure key generation method between two distant parties by wisely exploiting properties of quantum mechanics. In a QKD protocol, two legitimate parties, Alice and Bob, aim at sharing an information-theoretic secret key, even in the presence of an eavesdropper, Eve. In the quantum part of such a protocol, Alice (sender) and Bob (receiver) exchange quantum signals, e.g. single photons, which carry classical information, 0 or 1. After repeating this step several times, Alice and Bob share two n-bit strings, X and Y. Eve has access to a random variable Z, possibly correlated to X and Y.
In any realistic implementation of a QKD protocol, X and Y suffer discrepancies mainly due to losses in the channel and noise in Bobâ€™s detectors but which are conservatively attributed to the action of an eavesdropper. Therefore, any QKD protocol must include a classical post-processing step in order to extract a secret key form the correlated strings X and Y. After the postprocessing step, Alice and Bob agree on a residual key string.
The paper is organized as follows: in section II, information reconciliation is detailed and the previous work is reviewed. In section III, the use of polar codes to reconciliation in QKD is laid out. Finally, the performance of proposed scheme is demonstrated in section IV.

II. INFORMATION RECONCILIATION WITH LINEAR CODES
A. Previous Work
Information reconciliation is one part of a classical postprocessing. It is the process of finding and correcting errors through public discussion [2]. Alice sends Bob additional information that allows him to generate an error-corrected key that is identical to Aliceâ€™s. This information may be parity bits or syndrome bits. Indeed, information reconciliation is the counterpart of error correction is classical communication. However, there is one important difference: rather than combining information that allows correcting errors directly into the message to be transmitted, additional information is sent after key sifting is complete as it is only at this point that the message to be corrected in known.
The first reconciliation scheme was proposed in [2]. It was a simple scheme using binary search algorithm. Afterwards, CASCADE was proposed in [3], which is very elegant and compact. However, CASCADE has a high interactivity problem, several protocols have been developed that uses linear block codes. A protocol using Hamming codes, called WINNOW, was introduced in 2003 [4]. A reconciliation protocol using lowdensity parity-check (LDPC) codes was proposed in [5-6]. The use of polar codes in reconciliation was proposed in [7].
The use of polar codes has been previously considered for many scenarios [12-14]. Polar codes have some characteristics that make them fit for QKD error correction. First, they are easily employed in a rateless setup because the rate of codes can be freely changed. Secondly, they enable one-way error correction, similarly to LDPC codes, and contrary to two-way protocols like CASCADE.
The first reconciliation protocol with polar codes was proposed in [15]. However, this reconciliation protocol employed a successive cancellation (SC) decoder. More specific details on polar codes in QKD has been introduced, and specifically designed polar codes for the QKD environment were suggested in [16]. However, the performance of polar codes under the SC decoder falls behind that of state-of-the-art codes.
B. Reconciliation Efficiency
Information reconciliation is a general term to demonstrate any method that can be used to extract shared secret keys [8]. In

other words, X and Y are considered as the input and output of a modeled quantum channel, respectively.

It is usually presumed that Alice and Bob hold sifted keys x and y, two n-bit strings that are outcomes of X and Y. During reconciliation, Alice and Bob communicate a set of messages M to reconcile their keys. At the end of the protocol, they agree on a shared secret key in the presence of Eve while revealing some information. Therefore, X and Y can be considered correlated random variables, and y is given by transition probability í µí±ƒí µí±ƒí µí±ƒí µí µí±ƒí±Ší µí±Ší µí±Ší µí±Š{í µí°±í µí°±í µí°±í µí°±|í µí°²í µí°²í µí°²í µí°²} . It is given as if every symbol was generated by memoryless channel W, equivalently. Errors occurred during QKD are commonly considered as uncorrelated and symmetric. Thus, the memoryless channel W can be seen as a binary symmetric channel (BSC). The crossover probability p of the BSC is generally supposed as given.

The problem is how a message M is encoded. This problem of reconciliation can be treated as well-known Slepian-Wolf coding, which is a way of encoding two lossless compressed correlated sources [9]. The Slepian-Wolf bound states that (í µí±‹í µí±‹í µí±‹í µí±‹í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›, í µí±Œí µí±Œí µí±Œí µí±Œí µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›) can be compressed into more than í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›(í µí±‹í µí±‹í µí±‹í µí±‹|í µí±Œí µí±Œí µí±Œí µí±Œ) bits without information loss. This is the minimum information required to agree on a secret key. In practice, codewords will be encoded with a rate í µí±“í µí±“í µí±“í µí±“í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›(í µí±‹í µí±‹í µí±‹í µí±‹|í µí±Œí µí±Œí µí±Œí µí±Œ) , where í µí±“í µí±“í µí±“í µí±“ is the reconciliation efficiency. Therefore, efficiency is defined as

|í µí±€í µí±€í µí±€í µí±€| í µí±“í µí±“í µí±“í µí±“ = í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›(í µí±‹í µí±‹í µí±‹í µí±‹|í µí±Œí µí±Œí µí±Œí µí±Œ)

(1)

where M is a message or codeword Alice sends through public channel and | âˆ™ | is a cardinality.

Lower efficiency means fewer information leaks during reconciliation. More information remains in sifted keys, leading to a higher secret key rate. After all, a lower efficiency is directly related to the higher secret key rate, which is why efficiency is a performance indicator of reconciliation protocols.

III. PRELIMINARIES

A. Polar Codes
The development of polar codes by Arikan [10] was a major advance in coding theory. Polar codes have been proven to

achieve the capacity of symmetric binary-input discrete memoryless channels (BI-DMC) with an explicit construction. Moreover, polar codes have low encoding and decoding complexity, which makes them suitable for efficient hardware implementation [11].

With the Arikanâ€™s construction method [10], the generation matrix of a polar code is an í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±› Ã— í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±› matrix í µí°ºí µí°ºí µí°ºí µí°º = í µí°µí µí°µí µí°µí µí µí°µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí°¹í µí°¹í µí°¹í µí°¹âŠ—í µí±ší µí±ší µí±ší µí±š, where í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±› = 2í µí±ší µí±ší µí±ší µí±š, í µí°µí µí°µí µí°µí µí°µí µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± is the bit reversal permutation matrix [10], and í µí°¹í µí°¹í µí°¹í µí°¹ = ï¿½11 01ï¿½ . Here âŠ— í µí±ší µí±ší µí±ší µí±š denotes the í µí±ší µí±ší µí±ší µí±š th Kronecker power and í µí°¹í µí°¹í µí°¹í µí°¹âŠ—í µí±ší µí±ší µí±ší µí±š = F âŠ— í µí°¹í µí°¹í µí°¹í µí°¹(í µí±ší µí±ší µí±ší µí±ší µí±ší µí±š) . Let í µí±¢í µí±¢í µí±¢í µí±¢0í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±› = (í µí±¢í µí±¢í µí±¢í µí±¢0, í µí±¢í µí±¢í µí±¢í µí±¢1, â‹¯ , í µí±¢í µí±¢í µí±¢í µí±¢í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›) denote uncoded data bits and í µí±¥í µí±¥í µí±¥í µí±¥0í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±› = (í µí±¥í µí±¥í µí±¥í µí±¥0, í µí±¥í µí±¥í µí±¥í µí±¥1, â‹¯ , í µí±¥í µí±¥í µí±¥í µí±¥í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›) encoded bits, then í µí±¥í µí±¥í µí±¥í µí±¥í µí±œí µí µí±›í±œí µí µí±›í±œí µí µí±›í±œí µí±› = í µí±¢í µí±¢í µí±¢í µí±¢í µí µí±œí±›í µí µí±œí±›í µí µí±œí±›í µí±œí µí±›í µí°ºí µí°ºí µí°ºí µí°º. An (í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±, í µí°¾í µí°¾í µí°¾í µí°¾) polar code is defined by setting í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±  bits of í µí±¢í µí±¢í µí±¢í µí±¢0í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±› to zero, denoted as frozen bits. The information is transmitted by the rest í µí°¾í µí°¾í µí°¾í µí°¾ bits, denoted as
information bits.

B. Soft Cancellation Decoding
The belief propagation (BP) decoding of polar codes over factor graph was proposed in [10]. Compared with their SC counterparts, polar BP decoders are easier to achieve lowlatency. However, polar BP decoder need a large number of iterations and suffer from high computation complexity. On this account, a soft cancellation (SCAN) decoder is proposed in [17]. The SCAN decoding algorithm makes use of a serial message updating schedule, which is similar to the SC decoder of polar codes. By limiting the soft information propagation schedule in the decoding process, the computational complexity of SCAN decoders is much lower than that of polar BP decoders.

The SCAN decoding is conducted over the factor graph, which is derived from the encoding equations. The corresponding factor graph of a polar code with í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±› = 8 is shown in Fig. 1. This factor graph shows relationship between uncoded and encoded bits. In graph, Î» denotes layers and í µí¼™í µí¼™í µí¼™í µí¼™ denotes groups. Basic element of factor graph is represented in Fig. 2. Here í µí¼”í µí¼”í µí¼”í µí¼” denotes the node number in group. Each node has two associated LLR messages í µí°¿í µí°¿í µí°¿í µí°¿í µí¼†í µí¼†í µí¼†í µí¼†(í µí¼™í µí¼™í µí¼™í µí¼™, í µí¼”í µí¼”í µí¼”í µí¼”) and í µí°µí µí°µí µí°µí µí µí°µí¼†í µí¼†í µí¼†í µí¼†(í µí¼™í µí¼™í µí¼™í µí¼™, í µí¼”í µí¼”í µí¼”í µí¼”) which are passed to the right and left directions of factor graph. These messages can be computed as follows

IV. POLAR CODES FOR QKD
A. Source Coding with Side Information
As demonstrated in section II, reconciliation is a problem of encoding two correlated sequences. From the view of QKD, Aliceâ€™s string í µí±‹í µí±‹í µí±‹í µí±‹ is a source and Bobâ€™s string í µí±Œí µí±Œí µí±Œí µí±Œ is a side information. Alice sends a message í µí±€í µí±€í µí±€í µí±€ to reconcile í µí±‹í µí±‹í µí±‹í µí±‹ and í µí±Œí µí±Œí µí±Œí µí±Œ. It is exactly the same as source coding with side information. Aliceâ€™s string í µí±‹í µí±‹í µí±‹í µí±‹ is a source and Bobâ€™s string í µí±Œí µí±Œí µí±Œí µí±Œ is a side information, and a message í µí±€í µí±€í µí±€í µí±€ is a compressed version of í µí±‹í µí±‹í µí±‹í µí±‹ (see Fig. 3). In [19], Liveris proposed how to use LDPC codes to encoding two correlated sources.
In [18], Arikan studied source coding with polar codes, which is called as â€˜source polarizationâ€™. In this paper, we adapt a method of source polarization to reconciliation. Lossless source coding with side information using polar codes can be conducted with the analysis of source polarization.

A high-entropy set indicates í µí»¼í µí»¼í µí»¼í µí»¼ sub-channel indices of the largest source Bhattacharyya parameters, where í µí»¼í µí»¼í µí»¼í µí»¼ denotes the size of the set.

There are differences between channel coding and reconciliation with polar codes. First, it is that frozen bits and a high-entropy set are not the same. It basically originates from channel and source coding therefore they are computed differently. Second, codewords are also different. In channel coding, redundancy is conveyed with information bits but, it is not the case in reconciliation. Additional information is transmitted after í µí±‹í µí±‹í µí±‹í µí±‹ and í µí±Œí µí±Œí µí±Œí µí±Œ are obtained. Bits indexed by a highentropy set cannot be placed in í µí±‹í µí±‹í µí±‹í µí±‹ before encoding. Thus, values of bits are not required.

We propose a reconciliation protocol using polar codes under the SCAN decoder. The process of the protocol is not much different from that of source polarization. It is also similar to reconciliation using LDPC codes.

B. Protocol
To encode an arbitrary binary sequence, Alice and Bob prepare (í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›, í µí±˜í µí±˜í µí±˜í µí±˜) polar code where they share information about all source Bhattacharyya parameters of a code. They also agree with

í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±› í µí±›  1 âˆ’ í µí±…í µí±…í µí±…í µí±… í µí±“í µí±“í µí±“í µí±“ = í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›(í µí±‹í µí±‹í µí±‹í µí±‹|í µí±Œí µí±Œí µí±Œí µí±Œ) = í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›(í µí±‹í µí±‹í µí±‹í µí±‹|í µí±Œí µí±Œí µí±Œí µí±Œ)

(8)

where í µí±…í µí±…í µí±…í µí±… is a code rate. Conditional entropy í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›(í µí±‹í µí±‹í µí±‹í µí±‹|í µí±Œí µí±Œí µí±Œí µí±Œ) is a binary entropy of a crossover probability í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± of BSC.

V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In this section, we discuss the efficiency of the proposed protocol by comparing the results of protocols using polar codes under the SC decoder for block length of 2048. We have implemented polar codes under the SC decoder described in [16]. Through these simulations, we showed that the proposed protocol experiences smaller leakage for several QBER over the BSC.
As explained in Section II, the performance of a reconciliation protocol can be evaluated by measuring the amount of information leaked in this process. For the BSC with a crossover probability í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±, an ideal reconciliation protocol would disclose í µí±›í µí±›í µí±›í µí±› í µí±› í µí±›(í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±) bits where â„(âˆ™) is the binary entropy. However, a real protocol cannot avoid revealing more fraction which is measured by reconciliation efficiency í µí±“í µí±“í µí±“í µí±“.
Fig. 4 shows the efficiency, defined in (1), of the proposed protocol as well as polar codes under the SC decoder. In each simulation, the efficiency was divided by a unit of 0.01, and the simulation points that most approximated the frame error rate

Fig. 4 Performance of the SCAN and SC decoders with block size of 2048
(FER) of 10âˆ’3 were selected. The efficiency points selected are shown in curves revealing FER as a function of efficiency for two block sizes in the QBER range [0.010, 0.050].
Code construction of polar codes in each QBER was performed using the Monte-Carlo method [10]. Codes are constructed differently for each QBER to obtain better simulations. However, a single code designed for specific QBER can be used for multiple QBERs. We calculated and sorted the source Bhattacharyya parameter of each symbol. The size of the high-entropy set was computed as âŒˆí µí±“í µí±“í µí±“í µí±“ í µí±“ í µí±“í µí±“í µí±“í µí±“ í µí±“ í µí±“(í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±)âŒ‰. The SCAN decoding was conducted described in [17]. The SCAN decoder is restricted to the maximum of 8 iterations.
As can be seen on the figure, the SCAN decoder can outperform the SC decoder in all QBER ranges. With maximum 8 iterations, the efficiency is always more than 11% lower. This gain of efficiency can effect final key rate of practical QKD.
VI. CONCLUSION
We have shown that SCAN decoding of polar codes can be used to reconcile two correlated discrete random variables. The results show that the SCAN decoders are a good alternative to the SC decoders. In terms of reconciliation efficiency, they show a similar behavior but a huge improvement for all QBER.
