Abstractâ€” Recently, demand response (DR) technology applied with smart grid have studied as a method to minimize peak load and power loss. Many studies have used optimization tools to reduce peak load and to satisfy preferences and requirements of actual users. However, these studies did not focus on representing various types of appliance behaviors. In this paper, we study potent types of appliances to represent them as constraints for optimization problems in demand response scheduling smart grid systems.
Keywordsâ€” Smart Grid; Demand Response; Optimization
I. INTRODUCTION
Smart grid is actively researched to increase efficiency of energy production and consumption [1]-[5]. In particular, DR techniques can reduce peak load and power loss.
Real-time pricing with DR model sets high price for peak times and sets relatively low price for other times to reduce peak load [6]-[8]. Consequently, residential appliances are scheduled to operate in low-price hours to reduce electricity bills [5]. However, appliances have rules or desired time to operate because of their purposes or user preferences. Recent studies use optimization tools both to reduce electricity bills and to satisfy those kinds of requirements.
Studies using optimization tools formulate optimization problems to minimize electricity bills and evaluate requirement factors by electricity bills, so they can balance between them. In this case, appliance schedules are represented as variables and their operation rules are represented as constraints. The objective function of the minimization problem is calculated with these variables and constraints, resulting optimized appliance schedules. However, these studies focus on minimizing electricity bills in constrained problems, not focusing on representing the operation types of appliances.
In this paper, we focus on representing the operation types of appliances as constraints in optimization problems. First, we suppose operation types of appliances. Second, we propose typeconstraint conversion methods for those operation types. Third, we propose combination rules for conversion methods.
II. SYMBOL DEFINITION

Let í µí±í µí±ï¿½ be the í µí±›í µí±›th appliance, í µí²•í µí²• = {í µí±¡í µí±¡ï¿½, í µí±¡í µí±¡ï¿½, â€¦ , í µí±¡í µí±¡ï¿½} be the vector containing each tataiitpmmptieelmissalleoonscttleoí µaí±¡í µí±¡.tnaEdí µí±¡ní µí±¡.adí µí²”Icí µí²”ï¿½fhifí µí± =í µí± sï¿½í µï¿½í± í µcí± ï¿½ï¿½h{=í µeí± =í µí± ï¿½ï¿½d1,u0,í µí± lí µí± teï¿½ï¿½thh,í µeí± í µeâ€¦í± ï¿½ï¿½nap,istí µpí± hí µí± ï¿½ï¿½laei}a0anb-pce1petlvhiiaasenrsiscaccebhhelieesddufsuolclerehdnevtdteohuclotaeoppdrepronlaifoatetní µí±›í µí±›cttahoet operate at timeslot í µí±¡í µí±¡ .

III. OPERATION TYPES OF APPLIANCES
In this section we enumerate operation types of appliances.
A. Discrete Type Discrete type is a common operation type of appliances.
There are no restrictions in comparison to following operation types. Appliances in this type can operate and stop unrestricted number of timeslots.
B. One-Stop Type Appliances in one-stop type can start and finish operation
only once in time duration í µí²•í µí²•. Their schedule must be continuous in their operation periods. We should be careful when converting this type into constraints because the appliances in this type can start or finish operations outside of í µí²•í µí²•.
C. Multiple-Stop Type Appliances in multiple-stop type can start and finish
operation specific time í µí°¹í µí°¹. We can divide this type in two cases:
ï‚· Max-Stop: appliances in this type can start and finish operation maximum í µí°¹í µí°¹ times.
ï‚· Fix-Stop: appliances in this type can start and finish operation exactly í µí°¹í µí°¹ times.

D. Stepped Type
Appliances in this type have stepped operation modes that differing energy consumption. The appliances can change modes during the operation and the state transition pattern may vary.

E. Cooldown Type Appliances in this type cannot be restarted until after a
certain period of time once they have been stopped.
F. Sequential Type Appliances in this type must start operation after other
specified appliance finishes its operation.

IV. TYPE-CONSTRAINT CONVERSION METHODS
In this section, we propose conversion methods from operation types to optimization constraints. Note that appliances can have multiple types, so we can apply multiple conversion methods to a single appliance.

A. Discrete Type The nth appliance have desired operation duration í µí±‘í µí±‘ï¿½ during
í µí²•í µí²•. We can simply represent this as a constraint:
âˆ‘ï¿½âˆˆí µí²•í µí²• í µí± í µí± ï¿½ï¿½ = í µí±‘í µí±‘ï¿½.
Since discrete type is unrestricted, other types equally start from this constraint.

B. One-Stop Type

In

0-1 variable, í µí±í µí±ï¿½ï¿½ = (í µí± í µí± ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ is the change of the nth

âˆ’ í µí± í µí± ï¿½ï¿½)ï¿½ must be 0 or 1. applianceâ€™s operation

state. Appliances in one-stop type must change their state less

then or equal to 2. If the nth appliance is one-stop type and

scheduled to operate at í µí±¡í µí±¡ï¿½ or í µí±¡í µí±¡ï¿½, the number of state change will decrease 1 for each. This insight can be converted into a

constraint:

ï¿½
ï¿½(í µí± í µí± ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ âˆ’ í µí± í µí± ï¿½ï¿½)ï¿½ = 2 âˆ’ í µí± í µí± ï¿½ï¿½ âˆ’ í µí± í µí± ï¿½ï¿½.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
Note that the constraint is in quadratic form.

C. Multiple-Stop Type
If appliances in multiple-stop type have to operate í µí°¹í µí°¹ number of periods, the number of operation state changes is at most 2í µí°¹í µí°¹. Considering the conversion method of one-stop type, the number of state change should be decreased if the appliance is scheduled to operate at í µí±¡í µí±¡ï¿½ or í µí±¡í µí±¡ï¿½. Note that the constraint is in quadratic form, the constraint should be:

ï¿½
ï¿½(í µí± í µí± ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ âˆ’ í µí± í µí± ï¿½ï¿½)ï¿½ = 2í µí°¹í µí°¹ âˆ’ í µí± í µí± ï¿½ï¿½ âˆ’ í µí± í µí± ï¿½ï¿½.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
In max-stop:

ï¿½
ï¿½(í µí± í µí± ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ âˆ’ í µí± í µí± ï¿½ï¿½)ï¿½ â‰¤ 2í µí°¹í µí°¹ âˆ’ í µí± í µí± ï¿½ï¿½ âˆ’ í µí± í µí± ï¿½ï¿½.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

This approach is simpler than separating appliance into logical components, as the method will be introduced for stepped type.

D. Stepped Type
If an appliance in this type has í µí±€í µí±€ stepped operation modes, the appliance can logically be separated into í µí±€í µí±€ component appliances. Each component appliance consumes â€œadditionalâ€ energy increased from its lower state, except the first component representing the lowest energy consumption mode. Note that the number of appliances increased after the separation, so the input to the optimization model is changed. With this method we can represent stepped type appliances, without changing the optimization model or adding constraints that are difficult to understand.
It should be careful to add constraints corresponding to the applianceâ€™s step pattern. Here is an example of 2-stepped type application constraints:
ï¿½
ï¿½ ï¿½(í µí± í µí± ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ âˆ’ í µí± í µí± ï¿½ï¿½)ï¿½ = 2 âˆ’ í µí± í µí± ï¿½ï¿½ âˆ’ í µí± í µí± ï¿½ï¿½,
ï¿½âˆˆ{ï¿½,ï¿½} ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
í µí± í µí± ï¿½ï¿½ â‰¥ í µí± í µí± ï¿½ï¿½. In this example, í µí±í µí± and í µí±í µí± are logical components and í µí±í µí± is the lower energy consumption mode and í µí±í µí± is the higher energy consumption mode. Considering the second constraint, the higher energy consumption mode can only be activated when the lower energy consumption mode is activated. In this case the appliance is one-stop type and will operate in higher energy consumption mode once, during the one-stop period. Consequently, the actual energy consumption of the appliance is sum of two energy consumption mode when it is operating on higher energy consumption mode.

E. Cooldown Type

If an appliance cannot be restarted until after Ï„ timeslots

once they have been stopped, it can be represented like:

ï¿½

í µí± í µí± ï¿½ï¿½

âˆ’

í µí± í µí± ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

+

1 í µí¼í µí¼

ï¿½

í µí± í µí± ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

â‰¤

1, âˆ€t

â‰¤

í µí±‡í µí±‡

âˆ’

Ï„

âˆ’

1.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

If í µí± í µí± ï¿½ï¿½ âˆ’ í µí± í µí± ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = 1, the rest of the left-hand side must be zero.

In other words, the appliance cannot be scheduled to operate Ï„

timeslots after it finished its operation.

We can observe that if we have a cooldown type application,

the number of constraints increase in proportion to Ï„.

F. Sequential Type
Representing sequential type application constraints is similar with representing stepped type application constraints. If appliance í µí±í µí± must start operation after appliance í µí±í µí± finishes its operation, the constraint should be like:

ï¿½

í µí±‡í µí±‡

1 âˆ’ í µí±¡í µí±¡

varies energy consumptions while operating and we can represent dependencies between appliances. We found relationships of appliance operation types and the number of constraints to represent them. Also various optimization and scheduling schemes [9]-[12] can be adaptive for smart grid system and compare with proposed method as a future work.
