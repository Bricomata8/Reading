Automotive collision avoidance system, which aims to enhance the active safety of the vehicle, has become a hot research topic
in recent years. However, most of the current systems ignore the active protection of pedestrian and other vulnerable groups in
the transportation system. An advanced emergency braking control system is studied by taking into account the pedestrians and
the vehicles. Three typical braking scenarios are defined and the safety situations are assessed by comparing the current distance
between the host vehicle and the obstacle with the critical braking distance. To reflect the nonlinear time-varying characteristics
and control effect of the longitudinal dynamics, the vehicle longitudinal dynamics model is established in CarSim. Then the braking
controller with the structure of upper and lower layers is designed based on sliding mode control and the single neuron PID control
when confronting deceleration or emergency braking conditions. Cosimulations utilizing CarSim and Simulink are finally carried
out on a CarSim intelligent vehicle model to explore the effectiveness of the proposed controller. Results display that the designed
controller has a good response in preventing colliding with the front vehicle or pedestrian.

1. Introduction
With the higher attention to the road traffic safety and
the continuous development of the intelligent transportation
systems worldwide, automotive active collision avoidance
system, such as forward collision warning system, has become
a hot research topic in recent years [1]. The automotive
collision warning systems are able to warn the drivers actively
when there is an imminent collision risk by providing the
driver adequate time to take appropriate actions to reduce
the severity of an accident. Some of these systems are
equipped with autonomous braking, meaning that the vehicle
will brake automatically if the driver does not respond in
time. Then the effect of the collision can be mitigated or
avoided. Preliminary studies suggest that such systems could
ultimately save around 5,000 fatalities and 50,000 serious
injuries per year across the EU [2]. However, most of the
current automotive active collision avoidance systems take
the leading vehicle as the collision avoidance targets and
mainly focus on the safety of the host vehicles, ignoring the

active protection of pedestrian and other vulnerable groups
in the transportation system. Indeed, pedestrian protection
is a key problem in the context of the automotive industry
and its applications [3]. It is necessary to take into account
a pedestrian as well as the leading vehicle or other kinds of
obstacle when designing the collision avoidance system.
Fortunately, certain contributions have been made to
enhance the active safety of pedestrian recently. For example,
Fredriksson and Rosén [4] compared the potential pedestrian
head injury reduction from current pedestrian passive and
active safety countermeasures such as bonnet/airbag and
autonomous braking. Llorca et al. [5] provided high precision
GPS information for a driver, detected the pedestrian ahead
by employing the stereo vision sensor, and designed steering
controller for the pedestrian collision avoidance based on
fuzzy logic. In view of vulnerable pedestrians on the road
traffic accidents, Milanés et al. [3] designed a fuzzy control
system with automatic steering focusing on pedestrian collision avoidance, realizing the braking behavior for pedestrian
collision avoidance of intelligent vehicle. At the same time,

they also pointed out that drivers are more likely to brake
than to steer when confronting such emergency situations,
although the optimal maneuver would be steering itself.
When designing the real-time control system, the vehicle
dynamics model must be established necessarily for better
reflection of the vehicle’s actual running status. Considering the strong nonlinearity of the vehicle system and the
uncertainty factors in the process of driving, the research
on modeling and the design of the vehicle dynamic control
has been conducted worldwide. For example, Ferrara and
Vecchio [6], who were motivated by the robustness features
of the sliding mode, designed a second-order sliding mode
control system based on a nonlinear vehicle model. Zhu and
Feng [7] presented a single neuron PID tracking control
strategy for overtaking behavior. Nouvelière and Mammar [8]
proposed an experimental implementation of a shared vehicle
longitudinal controller based on a second-order sliding mode
technique, which was tested under usual traffic conditions
such as stop-and-go, stopping at obstacles, and car-following
in a number of scenarios, but it mainly concentrated on
the low velocity. Lee and Kim [9] controlled the relative
velocity and distance of the vehicles by taking advantage of
fuzzy logic theory. However, they ignored the influence of
the dynamic characteristics of an engine model and the slip
characteristics of the tire model, which is difficult to reflect
the control effect in the real working conditions. Compared
with fuzzy logic control, the sliding mode control and the
neural network PID control have more strong robustness
and can adapt to environmental changes. The fuzzy logic
controller has to adjust a lot of parameters, and a good choice
of rule base and parameters of membership functions is more
important [10]. Majdoub et al. [11] built a nonlinear vehicle
longitudinal motion model that accounted for most vehicle
nonlinear dynamics including the tire-road interaction to
ensure global stabilization and longitudinal velocity regulation during acceleration or deceleration driving modes.
Taking the forward pedestrians and vehicles as targets
at the same time, an advanced emergency braking control
system is presented for the vehicle collision avoiding system.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2
puts forward the braking control strategies and establishes
the vehicle longitudinal dynamics model; the controller is
designed when confronting deceleration or emergency braking conditions. Cosimulations utilizing CarSim and Simulink
are finally carried out on a CarSim intelligent vehicle model
in Section 3, which takes into account the longitudinal tire
forces and tire dynamics, to explore the effectiveness of the
proposed controller. Section 4 concludes this paper.

2. Methodology
2.1. Braking Control Strategy. The automotive longitudinal
active collision avoidance system includes the following key
techniques: environment perception and processing, evaluation of the traffic safety state, vehicle dynamics modeling,
and control execution techniques. The main purpose of environment perception and processing is to detect the vehicle
running parameters in real time, using all kinds of sensors

to obtain the accurate and reliable driving information after
certain necessary signal processing.
After the detection of the pedestrians and vehicles ahead,
the host vehicle must keep a safe distance from the front
obstacle. Otherwise, it needs to be controlled when it is
judged as danger. In this paper, the collision avoidance
scenarios are simplified as follows [12]. Firstly, the dangerous
obstacles ahead within the same lane are taken into account.
Secondly, the autonomous brake maneuver is adopted instead
of lane changing when a front vehicle or pedestrian emerges.
Thirdly, the traffic safety is the main goal, ignoring the road
traffic efficiency. Finally, the pedestrian velocity is negligible
in reference to the velocity of the host vehicle and assumed to
be zero in the same lane. Then the following three scenarios
can be defined.
(a) The Leading Vehicle Decelerating and Braking. The traffic
safety state is estimated on the basis of processing the leading
vehicle information in the same lane; thus, a minimum safety
distance model for collision avoiding is established based
on the theoretical analysis on brake process of automobiles.
Figure 1 shows a schematic view of this scenario.
As shown in Figure 1, 𝑑 represents the real-time distance
between the host vehicle and the leading vehicle; if the host
vehicle detects the leading vehicle decelerating, the host
vehicle must decelerate or even brake to ensure a safety
distance between each other. The critical braking distance can
be obtained according to the safety distance model during the
braking process as follows [13]:
𝑑𝑤1 = Vℎ 𝑡𝑟 +

(Vℎ − V𝑙 ) 𝑡𝑖 Vℎ2 − V𝑙2
+
+ 𝑑min ,
2
2𝑓𝑔

(1)

where 𝑑𝑤1 is the critical braking distance for decelerating,
Vℎ and V𝑙 represent the original velocity of the host and the
leading vehicle, respectively, 𝑡𝑟 is the sum of response time of
the driver and braking coordination time ranging from 0.8 to
1.2 s, 𝑡𝑖 is the growth time of the braking deceleration which
varies from 0.1 to 0.2 s, 𝑓 denotes the friction coefficient of the
road, 𝑔 is referred to as the acceleration of gravity, 𝑑min is the
minimum distance between the host and the leading vehicle
when they stop, ranging from 2 to 5 m.
After obtaining the critical braking distance, it is necessary to assess the current traffic safety state. According to (2),
if the real-time distance 𝑑 between the host vehicle and the
leading vehicle is greater than the critical braking distance,
the traffic state is safe and the vehicle can run with its current
velocity [14]. Otherwise, if the driver does not decelerate or

take other security measures when the current distance is
lower than or equal to the critical braking distance, this state
is judged to be dangerous and automatic braking deceleration
on the host vehicle needs to be carried out immediately:

𝑑 ≤ 𝑑𝑤1 ,

(b) Pedestrian or Static Obstacle Appears in the Same Lane.
Figure 2 shows a schematic view of a pedestrian appearing in
front of the host vehicle. 𝑑 represents the real-time distance
between the host vehicle and the pedestrian ahead.
In the same way, the traffic safety state can be estimated
according to the relative distance between the host vehicle
and pedestrian ahead or obstacle in the same lane. The
walking velocity of pedestrian is neglected in reference to the
host vehicle and assumed to be zero. Then the critical braking
distance between the host vehicle and the pedestrian could be
calculated by
𝑑𝑤2 = Vℎ (𝑡𝑟 +

(3)

where 𝑑𝑤2 is the critical braking distance for decelerating and
𝑑min is the minimum distance between the host vehicle and
the pedestrian when they stop, ranging from 2 to 5 m.
If the relative real-time distance 𝑑 is larger than the critical
braking distance, the vehicle could keep the original velocity
and the pedestrian can cross the lane in safety. If the relative
distance is lower than or equal to the critical braking distance,
as shown in (4), and the driver still does not decelerate or take
other security measures, this state is judged to be dangerous
and automatic braking deceleration on the host vehicle needs
to be implemented immediately:
𝑑 > 𝑑𝑤2 ,
𝑑 ≤ 𝑑𝑤2 ,

dangerous.

(c) Obstacles Appear Suddenly. When the pedestrians from a
very close distance are getting across the road quickly and
fairly suddenly or the unexpected obstacles appear suddenly
in front of the vehicle on the same lane when driving,
we can obtain the real-time relative distance 𝑑 which is
too small between the obstacles and the host vehicle. This
state, which meets the formula as follows, is judged to be
extremely dangerous and needs to control the vehicle with the
maximum braking deceleration in emergency circumstances
at the same time:

𝑑 ≤ 𝑤2 ,

2.2. Vehicle Model
(a) The Vehicle Longitudinal Dynamics Model. The vehicle
dynamics simulation model is constructed on the basis of
the CarSim software in this paper, including vehicle body,

transmission system, braking system, suspension system,
steering system, and tire system. Today, CarSim is one of the
most widely used vehicle dynamics simulation packages in
industry [15]. Adopting the CarSim vehicle model, one can
simulate its real operation condition and reflect the system
dynamic characteristic and balance model accuracy, making
the simulation results better consistent with the real scene
[16]. It is necessary to simulate the physical characteristics
of the prototype parts accurately as much as possible in
the modeling process in order to maintain the consistency
of the characteristic of the CarSim model and the physical
prototype.
The vehicle model can be built utilizing the CarSim
software according to the structural parameters, as well as
the model of the engine, transmission, steering, and other
components. However, some parts cannot be defined in
CarSim specifically, such as the characteristics of the brake
system. For the reason that CarSim is able to interface
with external MATLAB and Simulink easily, those parts
can be defined in Simulink; therefore, the vehicle inverse
longitudinal dynamics model should be built firstly.
(b) The Vehicle Inverse Longitudinal Dynamics Model. The
desired throttle opening and brake pressure are calculated
according to the requirements of the desired acceleration.
They can be applied to vehicle dynamics system by the inverse
engine model and braking actuator to control the acceleration
and uniform motion of the vehicle [17]. Considering the
situation that controlling the throttle and brake at the same
time can lead to system shock in the actual driving process,
it is needed to control the throttle and brake according to the
desired acceleration [18].
We obtain the maximum acceleration 𝑎max under different velocity with CarSim by setting the value of throttle to be
zero. In order to improve passenger’s comfort and to prevent
frequent switching between the throttle control and braking
control during the controlling process, a buffer zone for the
deceleration value is set [19]. Then the switching logic can be
expressed as follows:
𝑎des > 𝑎max + Δ𝑎,

throttle control

𝑎des ≤ 𝑎max − Δ𝑎,

braking control,

(6)

where 𝑎des is the vehicle desired acceleration, 𝑎max is the
maximum acceleration, and Δ𝑎 is the buffer value, which is
set to 0.02 m/s2 .
The switching schematic of throttle control and brake
control which is built in Simulink is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3: Switching logic schematic of the throttle control and brake control.

This switching logic schematic can choose the different
control strategy by (6) according to the vehicle desired
acceleration 𝑎des and export the desired braking pressure
𝑃des or the desired throttle opening 𝑟des . Then the logic of
subcomponents including the throttle control and the brake
control is explained in detail as follows.
If the judging outcome is the throttle control, the desired
engine torque can be calculated according to the requirement
of the desired acceleration. Then the throttle aperture can be
deduced from the inverse engine model. Ignoring the quality
conversion of vehicles rotating parts, the vehicle longitudinal
dynamics equation is as follows:
𝑚𝑎des = 𝐹𝑡 − 𝐹𝑥𝑏 − ∑ 𝐹 (V) ,

(7)

where 𝑚 is the whole vehicle mass and 𝐹𝑡 is the driving
force of the vehicle from the road due to the driving effect
of the engine, whose value is zero when braking. 𝐹𝑥𝑏 is the
braking force on the vehicle from the road due to the effect of
brake, whose value is zero when driving. ∑ 𝐹(V) is the sum of
resistance because of wind and rolling; namely,
1
∑ 𝐹 (V) = 𝐶𝐷𝐴𝜌V2 + 𝑚𝑔𝑓,
2

(8)

where 𝜌 denotes the air density, 𝐶𝐷 represents the aerodynamic drag coefficient, 𝐴 indicates the windward area, V is
the vehicle velocity, and 𝑓 denotes the friction coefficient of
the road.
Ignoring the elastic deformation of the drive train, the
vehicle driving force can be calculated by
𝐹𝑡 =

𝜂𝑇𝑒 𝜏 (𝑤𝑡 /𝑤𝑒 ) 𝑅𝑔 𝑅𝑚
𝑟

,

(9)

where 𝜏(𝑤𝑡 /𝑤𝑒 ) is the torque characteristic curve of the
hydraulic torque converter, 𝑇𝑒 is engine output torque, 𝑅𝑔
is the transmission gear ratio, 𝑅𝑚 means the main gearbox
reduction ratio, 𝑤𝑡 means the turbine velocity of the hydraulic

torque converter, 𝑤𝑒 is the engine velocity, 𝜂 denotes the
mechanical efficiency, and 𝑟 is the tire rolling radius.
𝐾𝑑 is a variable and is defined as
𝐾𝑑 =

𝜂𝜏 (𝑤𝑡 /𝑤𝑒 ) 𝑅𝑔 𝑅𝑚
𝑟

.

(10)

The braking force 𝐹𝑥𝑏 is zero when driving; then, by
formulas (7), (8), (9), and (10), the desired engine output
torque is obtained as follows:
𝑇𝑒 =

𝑚𝑎des + (1/2) 𝐶𝐷𝐴𝜌V2 + 𝑚𝑔𝑓
𝐹𝑡
=
.
𝐾𝑑
𝐾𝑑

(11)

When acquiring the desired engine output torque 𝑇𝑒 , the
engine velocity 𝑤𝑒 , and the reverse engine torque characteristic curve 𝑓(𝑇𝑒 , 𝑤𝑒 ), the desired throttle opening 𝑟des can be
obtained accurately:
𝑟des = 𝑓 (𝑇𝑒 , 𝑤𝑒 ) .

(12)

If the judgment result is the brake control, the desired
braking torque can be calculated according to the requirements of the desired acceleration; then transform the desired
braking torque into the brake pressure based on a linear
relationship between braking torque and the brake pressure.
Under the maximum braking force of the road, the
braking force can be approximately expressed as a linear
function of the oil pressure in the braking line, and its
expression is as follows:
𝑇bf + 𝑇br 𝐹𝑏
=
= 𝐾𝑏 ,
𝑟𝑃
𝑃

(13)

where 𝑇bf and 𝑇br represent the braking torque of the front
and rear wheels, respectively, 𝑟 is the tire rolling radius, 𝐹𝑏
expresses the braking force, and 𝐾𝑏 is the ratio of the brake
force and brake pressure.

The driving force 𝐹𝑡 is zero when braking, so the desired
brake pressure 𝑃des can be calculated as

Define variable parameters of the upper controller as follows:

(14)

2.3. Controller Design. The design of control system is the key
of the automatic stopping research, which aims to realize its
function by the control of the vehicle longitudinal dynamics
[20]. Two controllers are designed in this paper, the braking
controller for deceleration and the braking controller for
emergency, with the aim of automatic stopping control under
different scenarios.
(a) Design of the Braking Controller for Deceleration. The braking controller for deceleration employs a hierarchical control
structure. The upper controller determines the expectations
of the acceleration of the host vehicle in the current situation
according to the requirement that proper distance should be
kept between the leading vehicle and the host one in the
same lane. The lower controller controls the vehicle dynamics
system to achieve the desired acceleration on the basis of the
output of the upper controller. The vehicle dynamics system
which was introduced in Section 2.2 includes the inverse
dynamics model and the vehicle model with CarSim. The
scheme of the braking controller for deceleration is shown
in Figure 4 and the detailed design process of the controller,
which includes the upper one and the lower one, is introduced
below.
In the upper controller, we obtain the expectations of
the acceleration by adopting the method of the sliding mode
control. Besides, the sliding mode control methodology has
the advantage of producing low complexity control laws,
which appear particularly suitable to be implemented in
the electronic control unit (ECU) of the controlled vehicles.
Sliding mode control methodology [21, 22] has its capacity to
completely reject the effect of bounded uncertainty acting in
the input channels, the so-called matched uncertainty [23]. So
when designing the upper controller of desired acceleration,
the sliding mode control methodology is adopted to solve the
problems of the system’s dynamics caused by the uncertainties of various natures in the automotive context. In order
to enhance the robustness against unmatched perturbations,
endeavors can be done by combination of sliding mode
technique with other robust strategies, such as 𝐻∞ and
backstepping [24]. Moreover, the controller in operation can
compensate a number of physical effects which are neglected
by the simple model of the vehicle to make the design of
the controller feasible. The same holds for disturbances of
different types, as well as for parameter variations.
Relative distance error is an important index of the
control system evaluation. In order to improve the control
precision of the model, this paper targets the relative distance
and relative velocity error between the obstacles ahead and

𝜀 ̇ = V𝑙 − Vℎ ,

(15)

where 𝜀 and 𝜀 ̇ signify the errors of the relative distance and the
relative velocity, respectively; 𝑦 and 𝑥 signify the longitudinal
position of the target obstacle and the host vehicle, respectively; V𝑙 and Vℎ denote the longitudinal velocity of the target
obstacle and the host vehicle, respectively; 𝑙0 is the distance
between the obstacle and the host vehicle after the successful
collision avoidance; 𝑙0 is set to 6 m; 𝑡0 is the headway time,
whose value is 1.5 s.
According to the theory of sliding mode control [25, 26],
the switching surface based on trending law in a limited time
for the collision avoidance control system is defined as follows
[27]:
𝑡

𝑆 (𝑡) = 𝜀 ̇ − 𝜆 1 𝜀 − 𝜆 2 ∫ 𝜀 𝑑𝑡,
0

(16)

where 𝜆 1 > 0 and 𝜆 1 > 0 are two parameters of sliding mode
control. The derivative of (16) is
𝑆 ̇ (𝑡) = V̇𝑙 − V̇ℎ − 𝜆 1 𝜀 ̇ − 𝜆 2 𝜀.

(17)

The influence of the friction, external disturbance, and
parameter perturbation are difficult to avoid in the actual
system; thus, choosing an appropriate control law, adopting
the symbol function sgn (𝑆), needs to be considered at this
time in order to make the first derivative of sliding mode
switching surface 𝑆 convergent; namely,
𝑆 ̇ = −𝛽 sgn (𝑆) ,

𝛽 > 0.

(18)

Then the desired acceleration of the host vehicle can be
obtained as
𝑎des = V̇ℎ = V̇𝑙 + 𝜆 1 𝜀 ̇ + 𝜆 2 𝜀 − 𝛽 sgn (𝑆) .

(19)

To analyze the stability of the controller, a Lyapunov
function is defined as follows:
1
𝑉2 = 𝑆2 .
2

(20)

Obviously, 𝑉2 > 0, differentiating 𝑉2 as
𝑉2̇ = 𝑆𝑆 ̇ = −𝑆 ⋅ 𝛽 sgn (𝑆) = − |𝑆| ⋅ 𝛽.

(21)

According to the Lyapunov stability criterion, when 𝛽 >
0, apparently 𝑉2̇ < 0 for all 𝑡 ∈ (0, +∞), the control
system is stable and can effectively restrain and weaken the
buffeting of the system, which has a good robustness against
the interference outside.
In the lower controller, the desired acceleration 𝑎des is
obtained by (19) and then takes the difference between
the value of the desired acceleration 𝑎des and the current
actual acceleration 𝑎ℎ as the input of the single neuron PID
controller.

A single neuron adaptive intelligent PID controller consisting of the single neuron with the self-learning and adaptive capacity not only has simple structure, but also can adapt
to environmental changes and has strong robustness. The
driver controls the longitudinal acceleration of the vehicle by
controlling the position of the brake pedal and then controls
vehicle longitudinal velocity in the process of the actual
driving. This control system becomes a strongly nonlinear
parameter time-varying system due to involvement of the
strongly nonlinear link of the brake and tire. Thus, a single
neuron PID controller, which is suitable for the nonlinear
control, is applied to the lower controller of the collision
avoidance control system, to meet the requirements of the
system’s precision and response.
The connection weights of the controller are adjusted
directly utilizing the improved supervised Hebb learning rule
in the literature [28], so as to achieve the online self-tuning
of the single neuron PID controller parameters, ensuring the
adaptability and robustness of the controller.
The state variables of 𝑥1 , 𝑥2 , and 𝑥3 required in the single
neuron controller are as follows [7]:
𝑥1 (𝑡) = 𝑒 (𝑡) = 𝑎des (𝑡) − 𝑎ℎ (𝑡)

In this paper, the learning rates 𝜇𝐼 , 𝜇𝑃 , and 𝜇𝐷 are set to
different value in order to adjust different weight coefficients
singly. The online correction of the weighting coefficient is
not entirely based on neural network learning algorithm but
refers to the actual situation, better meeting the requirements
of real-time and accuracy.
(b) Design of the Braking Controller for Emergency. When
the vehicle is in the state of extreme danger, the braking controller for deceleration may fail to realize collision
avoidance. Therefore, an emergency braking controller is
necessary to ensure the safety of vehicle and pedestrian.
Emergency braking needs to be carried out in an extremely
dangerous state with the maximum braking deceleration to
avoid a collision. A single neuron PID controller similar
to the controller for braking deceleration is designed. It
takes the maximum value of the braking deceleration as the
desired braking deceleration to control vehicle dynamical
system so as to achieve the desired braking deceleration and
stop the vehicle achieving certain safety distance from the
obstacle. The maximum braking deceleration of the vehicle is
−8.5 m/s2 . The scheme of a braking controller for emergency
is shown in Figure 5.

𝑥2 (𝑡) = Δ𝑒 (𝑡) = 𝑒 (𝑡) − 𝑒 (𝑡 − 1)

To test and verify the effect of the controller, three typical
scenarios are presented for cosimulation utilizing CarSim and
Matlab/Simulink. The simulation time step and frequency
are 0.001 s and 1000 Hz, respectively. This paper chooses
the main parameters of the intelligent vehicle prototype of
Dalian University of Technology (DUTIV) developed in our
research group to build models using CarSim. The parameters
of the DUTIV intelligent vehicle prototype are shown in
Table 1. The parameters of the CarSim vehicle model are set
according to Table 1. The longitudinal velocity, acceleration,
and location information of the vehicle model are transmitted
from CarSim to Simulink.
The parameters of the designed controller for deceleration are shown in Table 2.
The parameters of the designed controller for emergency
are shown in Table 3.

ahead of the host vehicle. When the real-time distance 𝑑
between the host vehicle and the leading vehicle appears
to be smaller than the critical braking distance 𝑑𝑤1 , which
is introduced in Section 2.1(a), the automatic deceleration
control starts to be implemented immediately. During the
simulation, the initial position of the leading vehicle is set
to 23 m away from original point and the initial velocity is
set to 40 km/h and the brake pressure steps from 0 Mpa to
15 Mpa. The host vehicle starts to move from the original
point with a constant velocity of 40 km/h. The performance
of the designed neuron PID sliding model controller is
compared with the standard PID sliding mode controller. The
simulation duration is set to 40 s to observe the changes of
velocity, acceleration, and relative distance. The simulation
results are shown in Figures 6–8.
Figure 6 represents the simulation results using two different controllers. Figure 6(a) shows that the actual braking
deceleration is nearly accordant with the desired braking
deceleration using the single neuron PID based sliding mode
controller. In order to avoid collision, the host vehicle braking
deceleration increases gradually following the desired one
at 12.1 s and reaches the maximum braking deceleration

of −5.1 m/s2 . Figure 6(b) shows the results of the braking
deceleration based on standard PID sliding mode controller.
Seen from Figure 6(b), the actual braking deceleration has a
certain degree of lag to the desired value between 12.5 s and
14.5 s. The difference between the actual braking deceleration
and the desired braking deceleration varies widely from 16 s
to 23 s.
As shown in Figure 7, the velocity of the host vehicle
based on the single neuron PID sliding mode controller
declines rapidly when the leading vehicle brakes and slows
down to zero at 18 s, while the leading vehicle slows down to
zero at 16 s. The velocity of the host vehicle based on standard
PID sliding mode controller is slower than that of the single
neuron PID sliding mode controller. From Figure 8, it can
be known that the relative distance remains unchanged
approximately before the leading vehicle brakes absolutely. It
decreases continuously when the leading vehicle decelerates.
Finally the distance between two vehicles based on single
neuron PID sliding mode controller remains 4.78 m until
they stop completely, meeting the requirement of the safe
distance and ensuring the traffic safety, while this distance
based on standard PID sliding mode controller remains
2.88 m, which is in a dangerous situation.
3.2. Deceleration Braking Control for Pedestrian Collision
Avoidance. In this case, the pedestrian’s walking velocity is
neglected in reference to the host vehicle and assumed to
be zero. The pedestrian is detected 50 m ahead of the host
vehicle, which is running at a constant velocity of 55 km/h.
When the real-time distance 𝑑 between the host vehicle
and the detected pedestrian appears to be smaller than the
critical distance 𝑑𝑤2 , which is introduced in Section 2.1(b),
the automatic deceleration control starts to be implemented
immediately. Before the simulation, the initial position of the
pedestrian is placed 50 m ahead of the original point. The host
vehicle starts to move from the original point with a constant
velocity of 55 km/h. The simulation duration is set to 40 s in
CarSim. The simulation results are shown in Figures 9–11.
As shown in Figure 9, the actual braking deceleration
is nearly accordant with the desired braking deceleration,
and the actual braking deceleration reaches the maximum
braking deceleration −6.6 m/s2 at 0.25 s. At that time, the
passengers would feel uncomfortable to some extent. Some
little fluctuations can be observed between 2 s and 5 s.
The actual braking deceleration reaches zero at 22 s. From
Figure 10, it can be known that the velocity drops rapidly
within the first five seconds and reduces to 9 km/h at the time
of 5 s. At the time of 15 s the velocity is already reduced to
1.2 km/h and finally reaches the desired value of zero at 22 s.
Figure 11 shows that the relative distance of the vehicle and

the target pedestrian is 50 m at the initial time and quickly
reduces to 16.5 m within the first five seconds. Finally, the
relative distance reaches the desired distance at the time of
22 s when the host vehicle stops completely.
3.3. Emergency Braking Control for Pedestrian Collision
Avoidance. In this case, the pedestrian’s walking velocity is
neglected in reference to the host vehicle and assumed to
be zero. The pedestrian is detected 25 m ahead of the host
vehicle, which is running at a constant velocity of 60 km/h.
The pedestrian is in extremely dangerous state after the
traffic safety state estimation, and the host vehicle should
be controlled for emergency collision avoidance. Before the
simulation, the initial position of the pedestrian is placed
25 m ahead of the original point. The host vehicle starts to
move from the original point with a constant velocity of

60 km/h. The simulation duration is set to10 s in CarSim. The
simulation results are shown in Figures 12 to 14.
As shown in Figure 12, the actual braking deceleration
reaches the maximum braking deceleration of −8.5 m/s2
immediately at 0.3 s. Some little fluctuations can be observed
between 0.3 s and 2 s. At that time, the passengers could
feel uncomfortable to some extent. Then the actual braking
deceleration drops rapidly and quickly reaches zero. Figure 13
shows that the velocity drops rapidly with maximum braking
deceleration, from the initial velocity of 60 km/h to 2 km/h
at 2 s, and reaches zero at 2.3 s when the vehicle stops. From
Figure 14, we could know that the relative distance of the
vehicle and the pedestrian was 25 m at the initial time and
gradually tends to the desired relative distance. Finally, the

4. Conclusion
According to the requirement of the collision avoidance
control system, the safety status was judged by comparing the
current distance between the host vehicle and the obstacle
with the critical braking distance. Then the vehicle dynamics
model and the vehicle inverse longitudinal dynamics model
were established in CarSim. The collision avoidance controller was designed based on sliding mode and single neuron
PID method, realizing automatic braking control of the host

vehicle for vehicle or pedestrian collision avoidance and
guaranteeing the active safety of the vehicle. The parameters
of the experimental vehicle were applied to the vehicle model
utilizing CarSim, which could better reflect nonlinear timevarying characteristics and control effect of the longitudinal
dynamics, possessing a certain practical significance and
research value. Finally, cosimulations were carried out on a
CarSim vehicle model utilizing Matlab/Simulink to explore
the effectiveness of the proposed controller. Results indicate
that the controller can realize the deceleration or emergency
brake when there is a pedestrian or vehicle ahead of the
host vehicle. However, more possible collision avoidance
scenarios should be taken into account. Additionally, the
proposed controller should be applied to the real intelligent
vehicle prototype which also can deal with the emergency
situation of more collision avoiding scenarios and consider
