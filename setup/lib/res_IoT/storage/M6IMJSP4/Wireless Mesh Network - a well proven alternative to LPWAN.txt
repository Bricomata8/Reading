– focus on NeoMesh compared to LPWAN – focus on Power Consumption and Total Cost of
ownership

Wireless Topologies
Mesh: LPWAN:

Robustness in Wireless Communication
• Raw radio performance is defined by Signal to Noise Ratio (SnR)
• Radio receivers can employ error correction to improve robustness
• In general terms, radio links with low signal levels, are more impacted by noise, than those with high signal levels

Typical Link Budgets
• LPWAN: >150dB • MESH: <100dB
• LPWAN is relying on receivers with high sensitivity detecting low signal levels
• MESH has receivers which are less sensitive and thereby relies on higher signal levels

Wireless medium
• Both Mesh and LPWAN operate in un-licensed frequency bands
• The noise floor is elevated due to many different systems operating

LEGACY MESH NETWORKS

Power consumption
• Asynchronous operation
– Devices are not synchronized to each other timingwise, and as such ultra low power is only achieved in “end-nodes” who is not capable of routing
Concentrator End-Device

Scalability
• Network Management
– Centralized network management – Single point of failure – Slow process when network grows in size
• Payload transmission
– Payload packages are either routed, or flooded into the network.
– When routed, algorithms from IP networks are being used, which are not suitable for dynamic topologies, nor for deep network structures with many hop counts.
– Flooded messaging is inefficient and not a good approach for battery powered devices.

Power consumption
• Synchronous operation
– All devices sleep autonomously resulting in ultra low power capabilities for all nodes, while maintaining full routing capability

Ultra Low Power – HOW?

Scalability
• Autonomous nodes for scalability
– De-centralized network management – No single entity responsible for network creation /
management – Neighbor relations are created and maintained
locally
• Patented Routing Protocol
– Optimized for MESH structures – Energy efficient – Real time handling of dynamic network topologies

NeoMesh Limitations
• NeoMesh is optimized for low-power
– ….and is not well suited for low latency (sub seconds) or high data rate (100s+ of bytes applications

LPWAN

Low Power Wide Area Network
• A number of technologies are referred to as “LPWAN” • There are two which are being marketed heavily:
–
• Subscription based, with a cost structure similar to GSM/2G/3G/LTE • “cellular” type network operating in the ISM bands • Relying on long range, with very sensitive receivers • Claims 10+ years battery life time
–
• Private or Public network architecture • Star or Star-of-stars network topology • Relying on long range, with very sensitive receivers • Claims 10+ years battery life time

Claiming 10+ years of battery life is easy…

Comparing Average Current
• Sigfox:
– Example from https://radiocrafts.com/kb/battery-lifetime-sigfox-device/
• AA 3,6V Lithium cell • 10 msgs/day => 6 year life time => 34uA average current
• LoRa:
– Based on “LoRa Modem Calculator Tool” from Semtech
• Assumptions : – 12 bytes payload (same as SigFox) – SF12, 20dBm TX power, Unacknowledged
• 10 msgs/day => 8uA Average (!! ALOHA type transmission – no guarantee for delivery)
• NeoMesh
– Based on Current Calculator in Config Tool
• Assumptions: – 12 bytes payload (same as above examples) – NC2400 module in 2.4GHz band – Avg 3 neighbours, 30s SCD & Beacon rate, 5000 Full beacon interval
• 10* msgs/day => 18uA average current (Acknowledged messaging)
*) Can easily transmit more than 100 msgs/day at same level

DEPLOYING A WIRELESS SOLUTION – THINGS TO CONSIDER

Important parameters to consider
• Payload data characteristics
– Size? – How often? – One way – or bi-directional?
• Power supply
– Battery? – Energy harvesting? – Mains powered?
• Total cost of ownership
– BOM cost – Maintenance cost – Subscription – License

Every application is special
• There is no technology which is ideal for all applications
• NeoMesh is ideal when:
– Payload size is small – Battery operation is required for all devices – You want to control your network and cost – The environment is dynamic

NeoMesh Application Examples
• Asset tracking – value boxes • Emergency rescue system • Agriculture – hilly landscape • Outdoor parking sensor solution • Utility meters with pre-payment
authentication • Communication system for rescue workers • Wireless Sensor Network for wires legacy
