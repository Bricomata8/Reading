Workshop objective

Develop an IoT application using the workshop material and the lessons learnt in the course
• Team-up: different minds thinking together are better • Propose a solution to a known or common problem • Develop a duct-tape prototype and show! • Each team will prepare a short presentation (four slides)
about the solution

WSN: isolated silos

M2M: connected silos

IoT: people and objects connected

Validate

• Scenario? • Features? Use cases? • Specifications?

Develop

Prototypes: HW, FW, SW

• Features (user)

Test

• Functional tests

• Simulations

• Field tests if apply

• What problem do we want to solve? • How that problem affects people? • How people are going to use this solution?

vs

• Solutions based on human necessities, not on technologies
• Avoid isolated silos! • Avoid unnecessary features, focus
on your MVP! • Ask yourself: who is the user? How it
will use our solution? • What is our value proposition?

Find a human problems to
solve

Create a solution that adds value to the user

Create a canvas of our solution, showing interactions between actors and technologies
