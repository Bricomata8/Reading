Low-cost LoRa Collar for cattle rustling applications
Prof. Congduc Pham
http://www.univ-pau.fr/~cpham Université de Pau, France

Overview
q We will show how to build a simple low-cost collar for preventing cattle rustling in developing countries. The system is proposed in 2 versions
q Version 1: simple beacon
q When powered on, sends every 10 minutes a beacon q The distance can be estimated with the beacon's RSSI q The gateway will receive the beacon messages and tries to
detect whether an alarm should be raised or not (no beacons for instance or very low RSSI)
q Version 2: GPS beacon with GPS module
q When powered on, sends every 10 minutes a GPS beacon q The position can be determined with the GPS coordinates q The gateway will receive the GPS beacon messages and tries
to detect whether an alarm should be raised or not (no beacons for instance or out-of-range position)
2

How it works?
q The collar will be fixed to the cow, around neck. Example picture from Afimilk Silent Herdsman for health monitoring
q In our case, reception of beacon means that the cattle is in range (with GPS, the exact position can be determined)
q If out-of-range, disconnected or damaged device, an alarm can be raised
q To detect collar cutting, the power wire will also goes around the catlle’s neck

Drill holes for connectors
Drill 2 holes depending on the gland diameter (here 12mm, so hole of 13mm) Place the cable glands

Use other type of connectors

Using female banana connector can be a better solution as you can use a standard banana cable

An even better solution can use aviator-type waterproof plugs

You can adapt/mix at your convenience!

Extreme low power (1)
q You can greatly reduce the power consumption by removing the power led (left box) and the voltage regulator (right box): 5µA in sleep mode
q See our "Extreme low-cost & low-power LoRa IoT DIY" video tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_VQpcC wdd8
8

Extreme low power (2)
q Then, inject directly between 3.2v and 3.6v into the VCC pin instead of the RAW pin
q You can use 2 AA batteries (3.2v) or a 3.6v Lithium battery
WARNING, do not inject more than 3.6v when the regulator is removed! You can destroy your board!
9

PCB with integrated antenna
q A PCB with an integrated antenna can be used
q To facilitate the integration of the Arduino Pro Mini and a smaller LoRa radio module (HopeRF RFM95W)
q To avoid having an external antenna that can be very fragile
PCB w/antenna designed by Fabien Ferrero from LEAT, University Côte d'Azur, France The PCB Gerber layout file is available and making can be ordered from Chinese manufacturers

Preparing the Pro Mini

Solder the header pin. Be careful to not put too much solder lead because we need to further solder the board to the PCB. Cut the extra length on the reverse side of the 6-pin programming header so that it will not touch the PCB.

Remove the power led with the tip of a cutter and the voltage regulator with a small plier.
11

Soldering to the PCB

Place the Pro Mini on the PCB. On the reverse side, solder the pin to the PCB. Do not hesitate to put more solder lead to make sure that it goes through the hole and make contact with the header pin. When done, it is recommended to check connectivity (with a multimeter) between each solder point at the reverse side and the corresponding pin on the Pro Mini.

Then solder a 2-pin header for VCC.

12

Put the radio module
Start by putting some solder lead on the antenna pin. Then, while heating this point, place the radio module and position it correctly.
Solder the other pins of the radio module
13

The battery pack

It is recommended to solder the wire to the Dupond connector

Use double-side tape, those used to fix mirror on walls

Cut the VCC header pin on the reverse side

Then position the battery pack and press firmly
14

Adding a GPS module
q Here, a GPS module is added to get an accurate positioning system
q We use ublox-based GPS modules q These modules can be easily
obtained from Chinese integrators q Ublox NEO-6M are sufficient and their
cost is lower: about 6€. q Ublox NEO 7M/M8N are supported and have
lower power consumption (55mA instead of 75mA)
Solder a 4-pin header if needed
15

Low power for GPS
q The best option to reduce the GPS power consumption is to completly switch off the GPS between 2 wake up
q The first GPS fix is usually obtained in about 30s q Each time the GPS is powered on again it can
be considered as a cold start but a GPS fix can usually be obtained in about 4s to 7s q We will use digital pin 8 coupled to a MOSFET transistor to realize a very low cost and simple ON/OFF switch
16

Using the 2N7000 MOSFET
See the heat-shrinking sleeves

We use a 2N7000 MOSFET transistor where the maximum current of 200mA is sufficient to power the GPS (about 60mA in acquisition mode)

The basic principle is as follows: when the voltage VGS applied on the Gate pin (G) is sufficient, current can flow between the Drain (D) and the Source (S). With the 2N7000, VGS is typically 2v with a max of about 3v but it can work with the output of the Arduino Pro Mini 3.3v digital pin
17

Connecting the 2N7000

GPS GND µC pin 8
µC GND

In acquisition mode, the device consumes about 55mA (NEO 7M/M8N) and about 75mA (NEO 6M). In sleep mode with GPS off, it consumes only 5µA!

The GPS VCC is directly connected to one of the PCB's VCC that will deliver 3.3v
18

Connecting the GPS
GPS uses serial, so connect TX and RX
This is what you should obtain 19

22

Mixed approach

Using female banana connector can be a better solution as you can use a standard banana cable

If you need a custom length, you can cut one end of the banana cable

An even better solution can use aviator-type waterproof plugs

You can adapt/mix at your convenience!
23

Put hardware in place
1
2 2
1
Connect the VCC from the battery pack to the first end of the cable 1 , through the cable gland. Connect GND from battery pack to GND on the Pro Mini.
3
Insert strongly the female connector in the cable gland, put some glue if necessary 2 . Then connect the wire to the other VCC pin on the PCB.
When plugging the male connector to the female connector 3 , the system will be powered.
24

Fixing the GPS module
Again use double-side
tape, those used to fix mirror on walls, to fix the GPS module to the box. Do the same for the antenna. Add tape if necessary, to secure the GPS antenna.
25

Flashing the device

Disconnect the VCC of the GPS because it will interfere with the serial port
After flashing, DO NOT forget to reconnect the VCC wire to the GPS module

Load the Arduino_LoRa_GPS template

Select Arduino Pro Mini, 3.3v and 8MHz and select the right communication port

Connect with an FTDI cable, be sure to match the VCC pin to the one of the programming header

Change the wake-up (idlePeriodInMin) time if needed
26

Fixing the battery pack

Use some silicone/putty to fix the battery pack to the box
Mark the UP position

The PCB height is exactly the one of our box, so it will also be firmly maintained in place when the box cover will be placed
The final result!
27

Ready for testing
The default configuration in the Arduino_LoRa_GPS example is: Use LoRa mode 1. Send GPS to the gateway every 20 minutes Node short address is 15. Digital pin 8 drives the MOSFET. BC (beacon counter) starts at 0, increases by 1 at each beacon, returns to 0 after 65536 beacons A GPS fix will be attempted during 35s maximum. After that time, a beacon with be sent. If the fix is unsuccessful, then the message is: \!BC/0/LAT/0/LGT/0/FXT/-1 If the fix is successful the message is: \!BC/0/LAT/43.31448/LGT/-0.36491/FXT/26271 Where FXT is the time to get the fix in ms

Mobility scenario with an autonomous gateway
A web interface displays the position of the gateway those of the remote GPS devices
33

Using CloudGpsFile.py
q CloudGpsFile.py is a dedicated post-processing module that will search in incoming messages a valid 'LAT' and 'LGT' field such as in "BC/9/LAT/43.31402/LGT/-0.36370/FXT/4180"
q You can enable CloudGpsFile.py in clouds.json. When a message with valid GPS coordinates is received, CloudGpsFile.py will write an entry in gps/gps.txt file containing relevant packet and GPS information, including the distance (in km) between the gateway and the GPS device
src waziup_UPPA_Sensor15 seq 188 bc 9 snr 5 rssi -90 time 2017-11-20T14:18:54 gw 00000027EB5171F7 fxt 4180 lat 43.31402 lgt -0.36370 distance 0.0224
q For distance calculation, the gateway position MUST be provided in the gateway_conf.json file (see Annex)
q For range test campaign, you can import (or copy/paste) this file in an Excel sheet to plot distance against SNR/RSSI

Maintaining a list of GPS devices (1)
q CloudGpsFile.py also maintains a list of GPS devices in gps/gps.json
{ "devices": [ { "gw": "00000027EB5171F7", "src": "waziup_UPPA_Sensor15", "seq": 188, "distance": 0.0224, "fxt": 4180, "bc": 9, "lat": 43.31402, "snr": 8, "time": "2017-11-20T14:18:54", "active": "yes", "rssi": -45, "lgt": -0.3637 } ]

q New devices (from src field) will be added, while existing devices will be updated
36

Maintaining a list of GPS devices (2)
q CloudGpsFile.py also extract from the list of GPS devices those that have sent GPS information in during the last time window
q key_GpsFile.py defines
q active_interval_minutes=20 q For instance, devices that have sent GPS info in the last
20 minutes will be indicated as active
q Those active devices are further maintained in gps/active_gps.json
q Further versions can also create kml or gpx file or any combination that would allow more complex visualization features

GPS NMEA

q GPS coordinates from a GPS module (GNGGA or

GPGGA field) are in NMEA format. We convert in

decimal degree

q 0302.78469,N,10601.6986,W

q 03 => degrees. counted as it is

q 02.78469 => minutes. divide by 60 before adding to degrees above

q Hence, the decimal equivalent is: 03 + (02.78469/60) = 3.046412. Multiply by -1 if S

q For longitude of 10601.6986 => 106+01.6986/60 = 106.02831 degrees. Multiply by -1 if W

q The GPS collar already provides GPS coordinates

in decimal degree

q \!BC/6/LAT/43.31416/LGT/-0.36403/FXT/5833

39

GPS degree,Minutes,seconds
q GPS from smartphone can be indicated in (degree, minutes, second) format
q 40°29'40.0"N, 3°34'01.0"W
q We can convert in decimal degree
q 40"*100/60=66.666 q 29'40.0" = 29.66666 => 29.66666/60=0.494444 q 40°29'40.0" => 40.494444, positive because N q 1"*100/60=1.6666 q 34'01.0" = 34.16666 => 34.16666/60=0.56944443 q 3°34'01.0" => 3.5694443 => -3.5694443 because W
There are many nice GPS tools that give you the GPS coordinates of your location
40

GPS on GoogleMap
q GoogleMaps accepts GPS coordinates in both degree,minutes,seconds and decimal degree
q If you provide in one format, it will also show the other format
q When you place a pin on a map, GoogleMaps also shows the location in decimal degree 41

Calculate distance (1)
q Several web sites propose online distance calculation
q https://www.movabletype.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html
42

Calculate distance (2)
q CloudGpsFile.py calculates the distance (in km) between the gateway and the remote GPS device
q The gateway's coordinates are stored in gateway_conf.json
q It uses the haversine function proposed at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4913349/ha versine-formula-in-python-bearing-and-distancebetween-two-gps-points
43

Determining the position of the gateway
q The gateway's coordinates are stored in gateway_conf.json
"gateway_conf" : { "gateway_ID" : "000000XXXXXXXXXX", "ref_latitude" : "43.31416", "ref_longitude" : "-0.36430",
q The simplest way to fill-in these coordinates is
q to use a smartphone to get the position, see slides 42 using GoogleMap
q Then to edit gateway_conf.json to enter the coordinates
44

Mobility scenario
q In a mobility scenario such as depicted previously in slide 33 , the position of the gateway can be updated dynamically by plugging a GPS module to the gateway
q The simplest way is to use a USB GPS module which are now quite cheap
q gateway_conf.json has a status_conf section where dynamic_gps can be enabled
"status_conf" : { "dynamic_gps" : true, "gps_port" : "/dev/ttyACM0"
},
q The GPS USB/serial port is usually /dev/ttyACM0 on the RPI3
45

Testing the USB GPS module (1)

q Plug the USB GPS module to your Raspberry and

go to /home/pi/lora_gateway/sensors_in_raspi

q Check with ls -l /dev/tty* if the port for the new device is /dev/ttyACM0

…

crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 166, 0 Jan 9 14:43 /dev/ttyACM0

q If it is the case, run

python 9600SerialToStdout.py | egrep "GNGGA|GPGGA"

q Otherwise run for instance

python 9600SerialToStdout.py /dev/ttyUSB0 | egrep

"GNGGA|GPGGA"

46

Testing the USB GPS module (2)
q After some time, you should see something like
$GNGGA,142843.00,4318.85982,N,00021.85223,W,1,05,3.87,224.9,M,49.1,M,,*5D $GNGGA,142844.00,4318.85994,N,00021.85229,W,1,05,3.87,224.9,M,49.1,M,,*57 $GNGGA,142845.00,4318.86012,N,00021.85232,W,1,05,3.87,224.8,M,49.1,M,,*59 $GNGGA,142846.00,4318.86013,N,00021.85233,W,1,05,3.87,224.8,M,49.1,M,,*5A $GNGGA,142847.00,4318.86025,N,00021.85230,W,1,05,3.87,224.8,M,49.1,M,,*5D $GNGGA,142848.00,4318.86030,N,00021.85226,W,1,05,3.87,224.7,M,49.1,M,,*5E $GNGGA,142849.00,4318.86010,N,00021.85225,W,1,05,3.87,224.6,M,49.1,M,,*5F
q Which mean that the module has a valid GPS fix. Press CTRL-C to stop
q Then run python get_gps.py
get_gps.py: removing /home/pi/lora_gateway/gateway_gps.txt file 43.31430,-0.36415 43.31431,-0.36417 43.31432,-0.36417 get_gps.py: saving gps coordinates in /home/pi/lora_gateway/gateway_gps.txt file
47

When enabling dynamic_gps
q Enabling dynamic_gps in gateway_conf.json activates the following tasks
q post_status_processing_gw.py which is periodically called by post_processing_gw.py will try to get the position of the gateway using a connected GPS module. It uses get_gps.py in the sensors_in_raspi folder
q get_gps.py produces a gateway_gps.txt file if a valid GPS fix is obtained. The file simply contains the coordinates in decimal degree: 43.31427,-0.36424
q If post_status_processing_gw.py finds a gateway_gps.txt file, it will update in gateway_conf.json the GPS coordinate fields used by CloudGpsFile.py
