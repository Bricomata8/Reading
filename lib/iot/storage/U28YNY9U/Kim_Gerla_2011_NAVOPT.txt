Abstract—The number of vehicles has been growing compared to limited road capacity, leading to severe trafﬁc congestion during rush hour. Urban planners are looking for solutions to reduce trafﬁc congestion. Realtime trafﬁc information obtained from vehicles can help reduce congestion exploiting the wireless communications architecture recently established for safety and trafﬁc control purposes. In this paper, we propose NAVOPT, a vehicular routing strategy assisted by the on board navigator as well as the navigation server. The on board navigator equipped with area map and GPS monitor, reports its own position to the server via wireless connection (WiFi or 3G); in turns, it acquires from the Server a minimum cost path (i.e. path with shortest travel time) under the current trafﬁc conditions. Under NAVOPT, the Server uses a ﬂow deviation (FD) algorithm to compute optimal vehicle routes by load balancing vehicle trafﬁc over alternate routes. We establish an analytic model of NAVOPT; we also simulate it using a SUMO simulator to verify its accuracy. From the simulation results, the NAVOPT model shows robustness to delay and speed and efﬁcacy in controlling the trafﬁc as the number of vehicles increases.

I. INTRODUCTION
Today, research in Intelligent Transport System (ITS) is becoming increasingly popular as inter-vehicular and vehicle to road side unit (RSU) communications are become available. In the past, ITS was limited to locally restricted operations because of the use of infrastructure sensors (e.g. induction loop, camera), which are available only in a few cities. A navigator equipped with wireless radios as well as GPS however can replace the infrastructure by providing vehicle density per road and vehicle speed. Vehicles exchange the trafﬁc information among themselves or report it to a trafﬁc management server to enable estimation of traveling times. Based on the trafﬁc condition learned from the navigator reports, vehicles can be dispatched optimally over multiple routes.
Given a stationary vehicle trafﬁc distribution, the optimal routing solution which minimizes the average aggregate trip delay can be found with conventional gradient methods, or steepest descent techniques. A good introductory paper is the ﬂow deviation (FD) method by Gerla, Fratta and Kleinrock [1]. The FD scheme was developed for packet switched networks, but it can be applied to any multi-commodity ﬂow network with a concave link cost (i.e. the cost grows more rapidly than the ﬂow). This is true for the delay on a packet network link, and it is also feasible for the vehicle delay on a road

segment, which grows faster than the ﬂow of cars and can become unbounded in a deadlock situation.
There is a difference however between the road segment and the Internet link. While on an Internet link the packet rate increases constantly until it reaches capacity (at which point the delay becomes inﬁnity), on the road segment the ﬂow rate initially increases and then peaks when the segment becomes congested. After that it decreases as a function of offered load all the way to zero. We observe however that there is another variable on the road segment that is monotonically related to delay, namely, trafﬁc density (i.e. number of cars per square meter). In fact, the delay keeps increasing with density and becomes inﬁnity when the density is equal to the ”parking lot” capacity of the road.
In this paper, we propose NAVOPT, a new architecture for vehicular routing. In NAVOPT, vehicles cooperatively sense trafﬁc parameters such as density and delay. These parameters become the inputs to the trafﬁc optimization algorithm. The algorithm is inspired to the FD approach. It computes the marginal cost of each link as the derivative of delay versus vehicle rate on the road segment (aggregated over all lanes). When a vehicle requests a new route, the central Navigator Server, using the FD algorithm, ﬁnds a path (from current position to destination) that minimizes the sum of marginal delays on its links. This is the classic shortest path problem. The Server reroutes the vehicle on the new path if the marginal cost of the new path is less than the cost of the current path. Otherwise, the vehicle stays on its current route (sorry!). The intuitive interpretation of this approach is that it is a steepest descent approach that removing density from a congested path and it adds it to a clear path.
In the implementation, the navigator server keeps track of road delays (and densities) and computes weights (from vehicle speeds ) for all road segments. We assume that for each road segment a delay has been computed ahead of time, which actually is available from popular trafﬁc congestion papers. When a car requests a new route, the navigator server computes the best marginal path and dispatches it to the driver. If there is no improving path, the driver will be kept on the current path. In this paper, we establish a numerical model for the NAVOPT routing and ﬂow algorithm and show a performance comparison between distributed trafﬁcs based on our algorithm and shortest path trafﬁcs by selﬁsh manner. In addition, we simulated same scenarios using SUMO simulator to demonstrate feasibility of our approach.

II. RELATED WORK
In [2], a system framework using trafﬁc and congestion driven vehicular navigation was introduced. Vehicles are used to estimate trafﬁc conditions based on their position and speed. All measured data is reported to the trafﬁc management center (TMC) via the cellular networks. This data is used to estimate traveling time on the main urban roads. After that, the estimated traveling time is disseminated back again to vehicles as a form of feedback through the cellular networks. Performance results from this approach shows the feasibility of probing trafﬁc condition with only a small number of vehicles, around 4% , rather than with conventional ﬁxed sensors like cameras or induction loops.
As probing nodes, vehicles sense and gather trafﬁc condition and disseminate the information through the inter-vehicle communication (IVC) or vehicle-road side unit (RSU). A framework for vehicular sensing was introduced in [3] which optimized message dissemination in limited channel bandwidth using data aggregation and information aging. MobEye as a vehicular sensing platform harvests urban trafﬁc and urban environment information and diffuses them opportunistically based on vehicle mobility [4]. Here high mobility of vehicles encourages data dissemination. It also proposes summary harvesting and summary diffusion to reduce duplicated data and save channel bandwidth.
TraNs [5] is an interactive vehicular simulator between communication and vehicular simulators (NS-2 [6] and SUMO [7]). Many studies about VANET have used a mobility model generated by trafﬁc simulators in off-line state. TraNs however provides programmable interfaces between two simulators to exchange coordinate information of vehicles during simulation time. In network centric simulation, for example NS-2 can acquire new node coordinates which are updated by the SUMO simulator based on realistic vehicular mobility model. Also in the SUMO simulator, mobility parameters (e.g. speed, route and lane) can be changed by command from VANET applications like safety alarm in NS2. Unfortunately, TraNs is not fully exploited in terms of effect of trafﬁc information on vehicular routing. With another version integrating CARISMA as one of trafﬁc simulators and NS-2, authors showed simulation results about vehicular routing in an accident scenario [8]. They stopped the vehicle intentionally before the accident emulation and the broadcast of warning messages through the network simulator. VANET instrumented with the safety or trafﬁc control applications helped vehicles stuck in the place of an accident using detours that reduced congestion. In [9], authors did similar simulations in a simulator combining OMNet++ [10] and SUMO. They compared performance when using TCP and UDP as transport protocols delivering trafﬁc messages in OMNet++. However,

vehicle trafﬁc distribution for load balance in urban scenarios has never been demonstrated in network and trafﬁc simulators.
III. NAVOPT: NAVIGATOR SERVER ASSISTED VEHICULAR
ROUTING
A. NAVOPT architecture
In NAVERO, we assume vehicles are equipped with a smart navigation system which supports wireless communications and features geographical map information. The navigation system has geographical positioning system (GPS) and WiFi (i.e. 802.11a/b/g) or dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) (i.e. 802.11p and WAVE) radio interfaces [11]. DSRC is mainly aimed at the exchange of safety messages for inter-vehicle communications. Also, vehicles can share trafﬁc information through IVC or VRC. Due to limited channels in DSRC, we can expect many vehicles to utilize WiFi channels since the spectrum is free for unlicensed users and the WiFi radio interface cost much less than the DSRC one. And there could be open WiFi access points that serve as RSUs to access the Internet.
Figure 1 illustrates NAVOPT architecture. The access points as RSUs constitute a wireless mesh network (WMN) and provide Internet access to moving vehicles as shown in the ﬁgure. The vehicles organize V-GRID, namely a mobile mesh network among the vehicles. In this NAVOPT architecture, the vehicles can communicate with each others as well as with servers located in the Internet through the RSUs, or; they communicate directly through the V-GRID using multi-hop communications like in VANET.
NAVOPT is implemented in centralized way; each geographical partition has a designated navigation server which provides optimal travel routes to drivers. Large-scale vehicular networks such as nation-wide networks can be segmented into many small-scale networks like city networks as a hierarchical system for scalability.
Vehicles gather trafﬁc information such as vehicle density, speed, accident locations etc using various on board sensors such as camera and GPS. In a typical NAVOPT scenario, some vehicles may not report their trafﬁc information due to the fact that they are selﬁsh or do not have wireless connections. However, NAVOPT can improve vehicular routing even with partially observed trafﬁc information and with control on

only a part of the vehicles, as we will explain in next subsection. Figure 2 shows a NAVOPT platform for urban vehicular sensing and communications [4]. It is composed of a communication module for sensed data distribution using DSRC or other radio transceivers, a sensing module, a processing module and a data base module for trafﬁc information management. Vehicles report periodically their sensed information, eg position, average speed, travel direction etc, to a navigation Server. Based on such information, the navigation Server can estimate travel time as a function of average number of vehicles on the road and delay to travel the road segment . Actually, the delay can be derived from the density of the road based on experimentally validated numerical models. However, exceptional cases like accidents can alter the relationship between them. In this paper, we limit ourselves to trafﬁc distributions that correspond to normal trafﬁc conditions.
B. Multi-commodity ﬂow problem in vehicular routing
In this section, we give a design overview of NAVOPT, a navigator assisted optimal vehicular routing. We can regard the stop-and-go trafﬁc model at each intersection as a store-andforward communication model. The intersection of roads is the same as a node (i.e. router) which decides a route and forwards packets in the communications network. In this context, we adopt a general queuing model of the communication network for our vehicular routing model.
Multi-commodity ﬂow problem is ﬁnding best routes for multiple ﬂows while minimizing total cost of routing (e.g. end to end delay) [1]. This vehicular routing optimization problem extended from store-and-forward design of packet networks can be formulated as follow:
min P (Φ), f ∈ F, s ∈ G
s,f
,where P (Φ) is a performance measure of multi-commodity ﬂow (e.g. delay or cost) for a given ﬂow conﬁguration Φ. F and G are sets of ﬂows and nodes in a given network topology. Requirement ﬂow, rf is an incoming ﬂow into the given network partition from the outside world. The ﬂow is constraint by the following network ﬂow conservation rule and must be positive.

xfji + r(fs(f ) or d(f )=i) ≤

xfij ∀f, i, j (1)

j∈G(j=i)

j∈G(j=i)

xfij > 0 ∀f, i, j

(2)

When a multi-commodity global ﬂow f satisﬁes the above constraints Eq.(1) and Eq.(2), the set of feasible ﬂows, F spans a convex polyhedron. A local extreme point in F corresponds to a set on non-bifurcated (i.e. not split on multiple path) ﬂows. [12].
From now on, we deﬁne the vehicular routing performance function, P (Φ) that can be expressed by delay cost, where the ﬂow conﬁguration, Φ is global ﬂow assignment on each road. The average travel time, T as the end to end delay from a source to a destination is,

T=

e=1

,where T is total average delay (hour/vehicle) of the global ﬂows, b is number of road segments, λ is arrival rate of a ﬂow at each road segment e and γ is requirement (total

vehicle arrival rate to the system) from external networks. A requirement ﬂow rf from node i to j can be written by rij, where rij is a n x n matrix at the given network that consists of
n nodes (i.e. intersections) and b roads (i.e. total road segments

in network). Then, total incoming ﬂows are,

road e.

Figure 3 depicts an example of vehicle formation to help

= 100 vehicles when we assume vehicle length is 4m. Thus vehicle density in the road is 250[vehicles/km]. Density can be varying with vehicle type (e.g. bus or trailer) and safety gap between vehicles. Based on this approximated density, road capacity Ce is derived as 100 vehicles/0.0067 hours = 14,925 [vehicles/hour] when we ignore micro-mobility model such as deceleration in intersection etc. Our model is useful to investigate the efﬁcacy of the FD algorithm for vehicular routing. However, the actual trafﬁc is quite different from the trafﬁc estimated by this numerical approach because of the many extra factors that impact our analysis.
In this study, our objective is to ﬁnd the optimal route assignment of the ”multi-commodity” ﬂows. For given topology and road capacity as described in previous paragraphs, the route optimization problem can be formulated as follow:

f = λ (8) (9)

Here the primary problem is relaxed by replacing the capacity constraint with ce = Ce - ε where the ε is acceptable positive tolerance. In NAVOPT, this unconstrained multicommodity ﬂow problem is solved by the FD method that ﬁnds the minimum cost solution using steepest descent in a differentiable problem. Flow deviation method is an iterative method. It evaluates at each iteration the direction of the steepest decent to ﬁnd shortest path ﬂow as the minimum cost solution as follows:

f n+1 = (1 − α) · f n + α · v

, where α is step size (0 ≤ α ≤ 1) and v is a minimum ﬁrst derivative path ﬂow. NAVPOT processes ﬂow deviation
repeatedly to ﬁnd optimal trafﬁc distribution which leads to stationary condition as T (f n) - T (f n+1) < ε.

IV. EVALUATION
We ﬁrst have established a numerical model of NAVOPT using the ﬂow deviation algorithm described in the previous section and have run simulations with the SUMO trafﬁc simulator. Figure 4 shows a road topology to evaluate NAVOPT performance, namely a 10 x 10 Manhattan grid where each road segment is 400m and maximum allowed speed is 60 Km/h. Vehicle length is 4m. Acceleration and deceleration is

4 and 4.5 respectively. Driver imperfection (σ) is 0.5. Here we assume a ﬂow from a source denoted by S to a destination, D as can be seen in the Figure 4. A set of routes (i.e. from F1 to F5) from the source to the destination consists of a shortest path and four alternate paths. Therefore, the routes have different path lengths. For example, the shortest path F1 has 9 road segments and F2 and F3 have 11 road segments.

A. Numerical analysis

Based on NAVOPT model, performance was evaluated in terms of average delay, average speed and average density under varying requirement of global ﬂows. Figure 5 plots performance comparison between NAVOPT and shortest path routing algorithm that is common in conventional navigatorassisted driving.
As can be seen in Figure 5a, total average delay of each route in NAVOPT is almost constant as the incoming ﬂow of the requirement increases while delay of the shortest path increases inﬁnitely from around 14800 [vehicles/h]. In case of NAVOPT, the ﬂow is deviated into different routes including the shortest path. In contrast, the shortest path algorithm suffers from increased number of vehicles along the path. In Figure 5c, average density has a similar curve with the average delay since the delay increases monotonically by number of incoming vehicles into the road each unit time.
According to ﬂuid trafﬁc model (FTM), the speed of vehicle can be derived by current vehicle density over the road [13].

,where the vmin and vmax are allowed minimum and maximum speed, and ρ(t) is current vehicle density and ρmax is maximum vehicle density of the road.
Figure 5b depicts average speed of the road segment. Average speed in NAVOPT is close to maximum speed allowed in the road but speed in the shortest path algorithm decreases fast as the density increases. Once the density becomes saturated

in maximum density, 250 vehicles/Km like parking lot, speed of vehicles eventually becomes zero without moving.
B. NAVOPT with partial Navigator penetration
In a real situation, NAVOPT cannot control all vehicles on the road. The navigator that instructs a driver to move along a route prescribed by the NAVOPT server might not be available on some of the vehicles. It may also happen that the on board navigator does not have Internet connectivity or the driver does not follow NAVOPT instructions . Therefore the situation when only a fraction of the vehicles is NAVOPT capable must be anticipated. Based on these premises, the effect of ”partial penetration” was investigated by varying the percentage of NAVOPT enabled vehicles (e.g. 10% controllable vehicles).
Figure 6a shows average delay for the Manhattan grid topology for incremental ﬂow deviations. The step size was conﬁgured as 0.01 of the shortest path that is actually the minimum ﬁrst derivative path. The average delay decreases as the number of steps increases under ﬁxed incoming ﬂow rate, 14800 [vehicles/h]. It is remarkable that at the ﬁrst step, the delay drops from 0.4 to about 0.1. After that, the average delay still decreases but very slowly. This result implies that even only 1% deviation of the congested ﬂow (or equivalently, 1
The average delay with varying control factors is shown in Figure 6b. Difference exists in the average delay according to ratio of controlled vehicles. Above the factor 0.4 (i.e. 40% of total vehicles), however the average delay does not change; the 3 curves are practically overlapped. According to the comparison of average delay as shown in Figure 6c, controlling only 10% of the vehicles achieves the same performance as controlling all the vehicles. From this result, we can conclude that NAVOPT is a very effective method to reduce trafﬁc congestion even if the amount of controllable vehicles (i.e. navigator penetration) is rather small.
C. SUMO simulation results
We simulated the same scenario used for the numerical FD optimization using SUMO-0.12.0 simulator [7] which supports a micro mobility model for each vehicle as well as a ﬂow model. We generated a Manhattan grid map and multiple ﬂows

from same source and destination. First, all of the ﬂows use the shortest path and they are optimally deviated into the multiple paths that were obtained from the NAVOPT numerical analysis. Performance is evaluated (in terms of average delay, speed and density) for increasing inﬂow rate values, both under shortest path and under multiple paths set by NAVOPT.
Average delay for each road segment is shown in Figure 7a. Average delay in a road increases drastically when incoming ﬂow rate approaches 14800 [vehicles/hour] in case of the shortest path scenario. In contrast, NAVOPT shows almost constant delay even if the incoming ﬂow rate increases. It is worth noting that the delay does not go to inﬁnity since the simulator automatically decreases trafﬁcs at congested inlets. The same result can be seen in Figure 7c. The density of a road became saturated as we kept increasing the incoming ﬂow rate. From this observation, another difference between numerical model and simulator is the maximum vehicle density on each road. Maximum 250 vehicle capacity per each road segment was speculated in our numerical model; the simulator peaks with only 40 vehicles. Also, vehicle density in NAVOPT increases very slowly as the incoming ﬂow rate grows. As for average speed in each road, vehicles in NAVOPT maintain an average speed near 42 Km/h while average speed of vehicles on shortest path drops near 34 Km/h. Average speed also saturates since it is depends on vehicle density in the road.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed NAVOPT, a new vehicular routing architecture that exploits vehicular wireless communications and navigator services. NAVOPT utilizes trafﬁc information (e.g. trafﬁc ﬂow, density, speed) gathered from vehicles to estimate traveling times and to ﬁnd optimal routes. We ﬁrst established a numerical model for vehicular delays in the urban grid. We the used the Flow Deviation routing algorithm in the NAVOPT server to compute optimal routes and to investigate key performance measures such as average delay, speed and density. Finally, we compared NAVOPT solutions to Dijkstra’s shortest path solutions. To demonstrate feasibility of our approach, we also simulated the FD algorithm in a Manhattan

grid using the SUMO micro mobility simulator. According to simulation results, NAVOPT improved speed and throughput by about 25% compared to shortest path routing - namely the ”selﬁsh” routing implemented by individual drivers when they use alternative routes around the shortest path. Also, NAVOPT reduces total traveling time by 40%. NAVOPT showed it could improve throughput even with partial penetration based on numerical analysis. As for future work, we plan to implement our algorithm on top of a combined Qualnet and SUMO simulator.
