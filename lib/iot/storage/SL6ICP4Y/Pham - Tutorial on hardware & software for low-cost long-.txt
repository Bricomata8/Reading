Powerfull microcontroller boards…

Analog pins
Come with build-in analog-todigital converter (ADC) which usually have 10-bit resolution:
0V means 0 3.3V or 5V means 1024 = 210

q In WAZIUP, Arduino-like boards are main

development platforms for IoT because they are

open, cheap and easy to use

q In addition, there are huge developer

communities for these boards

Temperature & analog output
q Vcc is 5V q If 0 means 0V and 1024 means 5000mV (10-bit
resolution) then 5000mV/1024=4.88mV is the granularity of the measure q A digital value of 100 means 100*4.88mV=488mV q If the sensor output is 10mV/1°C then the physical temperature is 488mV/10mV=48.8°C
12

Reading analog pin value
// sensor output connected to A0 analog pin value = analogRead(A0); // now need to convert to Celcius degree
13

Converting into Celcius

value = analogRead(A0);

Temp = value * 5000.0/1024.0;

// 5000/1024=4.88

Temp = Temp / 10;

// 10mV means 1°C

// now process and transmit the data

14

Generalization
q Depending on the sensor type, getting the physical measure from the analog/digital value follows a specific function provided by the sensor’s manufacturer
q Depending on the microcontroller board, the number of I/O pins and the operating voltage may differ
q However the process is always the same:
q Connect the sensor to the microcontroller board q Read analog or digital pin q Convert read value into meaningful physical measure q Then process and/or transmit

What a use case survey should provide?
q For each use case, it is important to know
q What physical measures are needed (e.g. temperature and humidity)?
q What is the frequency of these measures: min, max, avg (e.g. 1 every 10mins)?
q How many point of measure (e.g. 15)? q What is the typical environment where measures should be
captured (e.g. near the ground, in the water,…)? q Typical deployment size (e.g. 5km circular area)? q Is power available somewhere on site (e.g. yes, at farmer’s
premise)? q Is Internet access available (e.g. yes, at farmer’s premise)? q How end-users want to get/visualize their data (e.g. on cloud
and on a smartphone)?
